<h1>The Project Gutenberg eBook of Bibliomania; or Book-Madness, by Thomas
Frognall Dibdin</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="notes">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Transcriber's Notes</i></p>

<p>Thomas Frognall Dibdin's <i>Bibliomania</i> was originally published in
1809 and was re-issued in several editions, including one published by
Chatto &amp; Windus in 1876. This e-book was prepared from a reprint of
the 1876 edition, published by Thoemmes Press and Kinokuniya Company
Ltd. in 1997. Where the reprint was unclear, the transcriber consulted
the actual 1876 edition. All color images were scanned from the 1876 edition.</p>

<p>The original contains numerous footnotes, denoted by numbers in the
section entitled <a href="#The_Bibliomania">The Bibliomania</a>, and
by symbols in the remainder of the book. All of the
footnotes are consecutively numbered in this e-book; footnotes within
footnotes are lettered.</p>

<p>Some phrases are rendered in the original in blackletter; they are
rendered in <b><i>bold italic</i></b> in this e-book.</p>

<p>This e-book contains passages in ancient Greek, which may not
display properly in some browsers, depending on what fonts the reader
has installed. Hover the mouse over the Greek to see a pop-up
transliteration, e.g. <span lang="el" title="Greek: biblos">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p>Spelling and typographical errors are retained as they appear in the
original. They are underlined in red, with a popup <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note">Transcriber's Note</span> containing the correct spelling.
Minor punctuation and font errors have been corrected without
note. Inconsistent diacriticals and hyphenation have been retained as
they appear in the original.</p>

<p>There are frequent inconsistencies in the spelling of certain proper
names. These have been retained as they appear in the original, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bibliothèque/Bibliothéque</li>
<li>Boccaccio/Bocaccio/Boccacio</li>
<li>De Foe/Defoe</li>
<li>Français/François</li>
<li>Loménie/Lomenie</li>
<li>Montfauçon/Montfaucon</li>
<li>Roxburgh/Roxburghe</li>
<li>Shakspeare/Shakespeare</li>
<li>Spenser/Spencer</li>
<li>Tewrdannckhs/Tewrdranckhs/Teurdanckhs (and other variations)</li>
<li>Vallière/Valliere</li></ul>

<p>The original pagination used two sets of Roman numerals and two
sets of Arabic numerals. To distinguish between them, in this e-book
the Roman-numeral pages in the <a href="#INDEXES">Indexes</a> are
preceded by "I." The Arabic-numeral pages in the section entitled
<a href="#The_Bibliomania">The Bibliomania</a> are preceded by "B."
Some page numbers are skipped due to blank pages.</p>

<p>Page references, including those in the <a href="#INDEXES">Indexes</a>,
do not distinguish between references appearing in the main text and
those appearing in footnotes. Therefore, in this e-book, where the
referenced matter does not appear in the main text on the linked page, it can
be found in the nearest footnote.</p>

public may not be altogether unprepared for the re-appearance of
the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> in a more attractive garb than heretofore;&mdash;and, in
consequence, more in uniformity with the previous publications of the
Author.</i></p>

<p><i>More than thirty years have elapsed since the last edition; an
edition, which has become so scarce that there seemed to be no
reasonable objection why the possessors of the</i> other <i>works of the
Author should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span> deprived of an opportunity of adding the</i> present
<i>to the number: and although this re-impression may, on first glance,
appear something like a violation of contract with the public, yet,
when the length of time which has elapsed, and the smallness of the
price of the preceding impression, be considered, there does not
appear to be any very serious obstacle to the present republication;
the more so, as the number of copies is limited to five hundred.</i></p>

<p><i>Another consideration deeply impressed itself upon the mind of the
Author. The course of thirty years has necessarily brought changes and
alterations amongst "men and things." The dart of death has been so
busy during this period that, of the Bibliomaniacs so plentifully
recorded in the previous work, scarcely</i> three,<i>&mdash;including the
Author&mdash;have survived. This has furnished a monitory theme for the
<span class="smcap">Appendix</span>; which, to the friends both of the dead and the living,
cannot be perused without sympathising emotions&mdash;</i></p>

<p class="center">
<i>"A sigh the absent claim, the <span class="smcap">dead</span> a tear."</i>
</p>

<p><i>The changes and alterations in "things,"&mdash;that is to say in the</i>
<span class="rl">Bibliomania</span> <i>itself&mdash;have been equally capricious and unaccountable:
our countrymen being, in</i> these <i>days, to the full as fond of novelty
and variety as in those of Henry the Eighth. Dr. Board, who wrote his</i>
Introduction of Knowledge <i>in the year 1542, and dedicated it to the
Princess Mary, thus observes of our countrymen:</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span></p>

<p><i>This highly curious and illustrative work was reprinted, with all its
wood-cut embellishments, by Mr. Upcott. A copy of the original and
most scarce edition is among the Selden books in the Bodleian library,
and in the Chetham Collection at Manchester. See the</i> Typographical
Antiquities, <i>vol.</i> iii. <i>p.</i> 158-60.</p>

<p><i>But I apprehend the general apathy of Bibliomaniacs to be in a great
measure attributable to the vast influx of <span class="smcap">Books</span>, of every
description, from the Continent&mdash;owing to the long continuance of
peace; and yet, in the appearance of what are called</i> English
Rarities, <i>the market seems to be almost as barren as ever. The
wounds, inflicted in the <span class="smcap">Heberian</span> contest, have gradually healed, and
are subsiding into forgetfulness; excepting where, from</i> collateral
<i>causes, there are too many</i> striking <i>reasons to remember their
existence.</i></p>

<p><i>Another motive may be humbly, yet confidently, assigned for the
re-appearance of this Work. It was thought, by its late
proprietor,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. Edward Walmsley</span><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;to whose cost and liberality this
edition owes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span> appearance&mdash;to be a volume, in itself, of pleasant
and profitable perusal; composed perhaps in a quaint and original
style, but in accordance with the characters of the</i> Dramatis Personæ.
<i>Be this as it may, it is a work divested of all acrimonious
feeling&mdash;is applicable to all classes of society, to whom harmless
enthusiasm cannot be offensive&mdash;and is based upon a foundation not
likely to be speedily undermined.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1">[1]</a> <i>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Walmsley</span>, who died in 1841, at an
advanced age, had been long known to me. He had latterly
extensive calico-printing works at Mitcham, and devoted much
of his time to the production of beautiful patterns in that
fabrication; his taste, in almost every thing which he
undertook, leant towards the fine arts. His body was in the
counting-house; but his spirit was abroad, in the studio of
the painter or engraver. Had his natural talents, which were
strong and elastic, been cultivated in early life, he would,
in all probability, have attained a considerable reputation.
How he loved to embellish&mdash;almost to satiety&mdash;a favourite
work, may be seen by consulting a subsequent page towards
the end of this volume. He planned and published the</i>
Physiognomical Portraits, <i>a performance not divested of
interest&mdash;but failing in general success, from the prints
being, in many instances, a repetition of their precursors.
The thought, however, was a good one; and many of the heads
are powerfully executed. He took also a lively interest in
Mr. Major's splendid edition of Walpole's</i> Anecdotes of
Painting in England, <i>a work, which can never want a reader
while taste has an abiding-place in one British bosom.</i>
</p><p>
<i>Mr. Walmsley possessed a brave and generous spirit; and I
scarcely knew a man more disposed to bury the remembrance of
men's errors in that of their attainments and good
qualities.</i></p></div>

<p><i>In laying before the public the following brief and superficial
account of a disease, which, till it arrested the attention of Dr.
Ferriar, had entirely escaped the sagacity of all ancient and modern
physicians, it has been my object to touch chiefly on its leading
characteristics; and to present the reader (in the language of my old
friend Francis Quarles) with an "honest pennyworth" of information,
which may, in the end, either suppress or soften the ravages of so
destructive a malady. I might easily have swelled the size of this
treatise by the introduction of much additional, and not incurious,
matter; but I thought it most prudent to wait the issue of the present
"recipe," at once simple in its composition and gentle in its
effects.</i></p>

<p><i>Some apology is due to the amiable and accomplished character to whom
my epistle is addressed, as well as to the public, for the apparently
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>fused and indigested manner in which the notes are attached to the
first part of this treatise; but, unless I had thrown them to the end
(a plan which modern custom does not seem to warrant), it will be
obvious that a different arrangement could not have been adopted; and
equally so that the perusal, first of the text, and afterwards of the
notes, will be the better mode of passing judgment upon both.</i></p>

<i>SHORT time after the publication of the first edition of this work,
a very worthy and shrewd Bibliomaniac, accidentally meeting me,
exclaimed that "the book</i> would do, <i>but that there was not</i> gall

Collectors by writing</i> <a href="#PART_III"><span class="smcap">Part III.</span></a> <i>of the present impression; the motto

students: and in adopting the present form of publication, my chief
object was to relieve the dryness of a didactic style by the
introduction of</i> Dramatis Personæ.</p>

<p><i>The worthy Gentlemen, by whom the</i> Drama <i>is conducted, may be
called, by some, merely wooden machines or</i> pegs <i>to hang notes upon;
but I shall not be disposed to quarrel with any criticism which may be
passed upon their acting, so long as the greater part of the
information, to which their dialogue gives rise, may be thought
serviceable to the real interests of</i> Literature <i>and</i> Bibliography.</p>

<p><i>If I had chosen to assume a more imposing air with the public, by
spinning out the contents of this closely-printed book into two or
more volumes&mdash;which might have been done without violating the
customary mode of publication&mdash;the expenses of the purchaser, and the
profits of the author, would have equally increased: but I was
resolved to bring forward as much matter as I could impart, in a
convenient and not inelegantly executed form; and, if my own
emoluments are less, I honestly hope the reader's advantage is
greater.</i></p>

<p><i>The</i> Engraved Ornaments of Portraits, Vignettes, and Borders, <i>were
introduced, as well to gratify the eyes of tasteful Bibliomaniacs, as
to impress, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span> the minds of readers in general, a more vivid
recollection of some of those truly illustrious characters by whom
the</i> <span class="smcap">History of British Literature</span> <i>has been preserved.</i></p>

<p><i>It remains only to add that the present work was undertaken to
relieve, in a great measure, the anguish of mind arising from a severe
domestic affliction; and if the voice of those whom we tenderly loved,
whether parent or</i> child, <i>could be heard from the</i> grave, <i>I trust it
would convey the sound of approbation for thus having filled a part of
the measure of that time which, every hour, brings us nearer to those
from whom we are separated.</i></p>

<p><i>And now</i>, <span class="smcap">Benevolent Reader</span>, <i>in promising thee as much amusement and
instruction as ever were offered in a single volume, of a nature like
to the present, I bid thee farewell in the language of</i> Vogt,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> <i>who

<p class="tp">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">When</span> the poetical Epistle of Dr. Ferriar, under the popular title of
"<span class="smcap">The Bibliomania</span>," was announced for publication, I honestly confess
that, in common with many of my book-loving acquaintance, a strong
sensation of fear and of hope possessed me: of fear, that I might have
been accused, however indirectly, of having contributed towards the
increase of this Mania; and of hope, that the true object of
book-collecting, and literary pursuits, might have been fully and
fairly developed. The perusal of this elegant epistle dissipated alike
my fears and my hopes; for, instead of caustic verses, and satirical
notes,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I found a smooth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_2" id="Page_B_2">B. 2</a></span> melodious, and persuasive panegyric;
unmixed, however, with any rules for the choice of books, or the
regulation of study.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a> There are, nevertheless, some satirical
allusions which one could have wished had been suppressed.
For instance:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
He turns where <span class="smcap">Pybus</span> rears his atlas-head,<br />
Or <span class="smcap">Madoc's</span> mass conceals its veins of lead;<br />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What has Mr. Pybus's gorgeous book in praise of the late
Russian Emperor Paul I. (which some have called the
chef-d'&#339;uvre of Bensley's press<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>) to do with Mr.
Southey's fine Poem of Madoc?&mdash;in which, if there are "veins
of lead," there are not a few "of silver and gold." Of the
extraordinary talents of Mr. Southey, the indefatigable
student in ancient lore, and especially in all that regards
Spanish Literature and Old English Romances, this is not the
place to make mention. His "<i>Remains of Henry Kirk White</i>,"
the sweetest specimen of modern biography, has sunk into
every heart, and received an eulogy from every tongue. Yet
is his own life</p>

<p class="center">"The more endearing song."</p>

<p>Dr. Ferriar's next satirical verses are levelled at Mr.
<span class="smcap">Thomas Hope</span>.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
"The lettered fop now takes a larger scope,<br />
With classic furniture, design'd by <span class="smcap">Hope</span>.<br />
(<span class="smcap">Hope</span>, whom upholsterers eye with mute despair,<br />
The doughty pedant of an elbow chair.")<br />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It has appeared to me that Mr. Hope's magnificent volume on
"<i>Household Furniture</i>" has been generally misunderstood,
and, in a few instances, criticised upon false
principles.&mdash;The first question is, does the <i>subject</i> admit
of illustration? and if so, has Mr. Hope illustrated it
properly? I believe there is no canon of criticism which
forbids the treating of such a subject; and, while we are
amused with archæological discussions on Roman tiles and
tesselated pavements, there seems to be no absurdity in
making the decorations of our sitting rooms, including
something more than the floor we walk upon, a subject at
least of temperate and classical disquisition. Suppose we
had found such a treatise in the volumes of Gronovius and
Montfaucon? (and are there not a few, apparently, as
unimportant and confined in these rich volumes of the
Treasures of Antiquity?) or suppose something similar to Mr.
Hope's work had been found among the ruins of Herculaneum?
Or, lastly, let us suppose the author had printed it only as
a <i>private</i> book, to be circulated as a present! In each of
these instances, should we have heard the harsh censures
which have been thrown out against it? On the contrary, is
it not very probable that a wish might have been expressed
that "so valuable a work ought to be made public."
</p>
<p>
Upon what principle, <i>a priori</i>, are we to ridicule and
condemn it? I know of none. We admit Vitruvius, Inigo Jones,
Gibbs, and Chambers, into our libraries: and why not Mr.
Hope's book? Is decoration to be confined only to the
exterior? and, if so, are works, which treat of these only,
to be read and applauded? Is the delicate bas-relief, and
beautifully carved column, to be thrust from the cabinet and
drawing room, to perish on the outside of a smoke-dried
portico? Or, is not <i>that</i> the most deserving of
commendation which produces the most numerous and pleasing
associations of ideas? I recollect, when in company with the
excellent <span class="smcap">Dr. Jenner</span>,</p>

<p>and a half dozen more friends, we visited the splendid
apartments in Duchess Street, Portland Place, we were not
only struck with the appropriate arrangement of every thing,
but, on our leaving them, and coming out into the dull foggy
atmosphere of London, we acknowledged that the effect
produced upon our minds was something like that which might
have arisen had we been regaling ourselves on the silken
couches, and within the illuminated chambers, of some of the
enchanted palaces described in the Arabian Nights'
Entertainments. I suspect that those who have criticised Mr.
Hope's work with asperity have never seen his house.
</p>
<p>
These sentiments are not the result of partiality or
prejudice, for I am wholly unacquainted with Mr. Hope. They
are delivered with zeal, but with deference. It is quite
consolatory to find a gentleman of large fortune, of
respectable ancestry, and of classical attainments, devoting
a great portion of that leisure time which hangs like a
leaden weight upon the generality of fashionable people, to
the service of the Fine Arts, and in the patronage of merit
and ingenuity. How much the world will again be indebted to
Mr. Hope's taste and liberality may be anticipated from the
"<i>Costume of the Ancients</i>," a work which has recently been
published under his particular superintendence.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_A_4" id="Footnote_A_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_4">[A]</a> This book is beautifully executed, undoubtedly,
but being little more than a thin folio pamphlet devoid of
<i>typographical</i> embellishment&mdash;it has been thought by some
hardly fair to say this of a press which brought out so many
works characterized by magnitude and various elegance. B.B.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">To say that I was not gratified by the perusal of it would be a
confession contrary to the truth; but to say how ardently I
anticipated an amplification of the subject, how eagerly I looked
forward to a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_3" id="Page_B_3">B. 3</a></span> curious, apposite, and amusing anecdotes, and
found them not therein, is an avowal of which I need not fear the
rashness, when the known talents of the detector of Stern's
plagiarisms<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> are considered. I will not, however, disguise to you

<i>Hunting and Hawking</i>, printed at St. Alban's, in the year
1486; of which Lord Spencer's copy is, I believe, the only
perfect one known. It was formerly the Poet Mason's, and is

of whose curiosities [including some very uncommon books]
was published in the year 1788, in three parts, 8vo. Dr.
Burney tells us that Mr. White "was in possession of a
valuable collection of ancient rarities, as well as natural
productions, of the most curious and extraordinary kind; no

<p><a name="Footnote_7_8" id="Footnote_7_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_8">[7]</a> The reader will find an animated eulogy on this
great nobleman in Walpole's <i>Anecdotes of Painters</i>, vol.
iv. 227: part of which was transcribed by Joseph Warton for
his Variorum edition of Pope's Works, and thence copied into
the recent edition of the same by the Rev. W.L. Bowles. But
<span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> deserved a more particular notice. Exclusively of
his fine statues, and architectural decorations, the Earl
contrived to procure a number of curious and rare books; and
the testimonies of Maittaire [who speaks indeed of him with
a sort of rapture!] and Palmer shew that the productions of
Jenson and Caxton were no strangers to his library. <i>Annales
Typographici</i>, vol. I. 13. edit. 1719. <i>History of
Printing</i>, p. v. "There is nothing that so surely proves the
pre-eminence of virtue more than the universal admiration of
mankind, and the respect paid it even by persons in opposite
interests; and more than this, it is a sparkling gem which
even time does not destroy: it is hung up in the Temple of
Fame, and respected for ever." <i>Continuation of Granger</i>,
vol. I. 37, &amp;c. "He raised, continues Mr. Noble, a
collection of Antiques that were unrivalled by any subject.
His learning made him a fit companion for the literati.
Wilton will ever be a monument of his extensive knowledge;
and the princely presents it contains, of the high
estimation in which he was held by foreign potentates, as
well as by the many monarchs he saw and served at home. He
lived rather as a primitive christian; in his behaviour,
meek: in his dress, plain: rather retired, conversing but
little." Burnet, in the <i>History of his own Times</i>, has
spoken of the Earl with spirit and propriety.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Alas, Poor Hearne</span>!</p>

<p>thy merits, which are now fully appreciated, deserve an
ampler notice! In spite of Gibbon's unmerciful critique
[<i>Posthumous Works</i>, vol. II. 711.], the productions of this
modest, erudite, and indefatigable antiquary are rising in
price proportionably to their worth. If he had only edited
the <i>Collectanea</i> and <i>Itinerary</i> of his favourite Leland,
he would have stood on high ground in the department of
literature and antiquities; but his other and numerous works
place him on a much loftier eminence. Of these, the present
is not the place to make mention; suffice it to say that,
for copies of his works, on <span class="smcap">Large Paper</span>, which the author
used to advertise as selling for 7<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i>, or about
which placards, to the same effect, used to be stuck on the
walls of the colleges,&mdash;these very copies are now sometimes
sold for more than the like number of guineas! It is amusing
to observe that the lapse of a few years only has caused
such a rise in the article of <span class="smcap">Hearne</span>; and that the Peter
Langtoft on large paper, which at Rowe Mores's sale [Bibl.
Mores. N<span class="super">o</span>. 2191.] was purchased for £1. 2<i>s.</i> produced at
a late sale, [A.D. 1808] £37! A complete list of Hearne's
Pieces will be found at the end of his Life, printed with
Leland's, &amp;c., at the Clarendon Press, in 1772, 8vo. Of
these the "<i>Acta Apostolorum</i>, Gr. Lat;" and "<i>Aluredi
Beverlacensis Annales</i>," are, I believe, the scarcest. It is
wonderful to think how this amiable and excellent man
persevered "through evil report and good report," in
illustrating the antiquities of his country. To the very
last he appears to have been molested; and among his
persecutors, the learned editor of Josephus and Dionysius
Halicarnasseus, Dr. Hudson, must be ranked, to the disgrace
of himself and the party which he espoused. "Hearne was
buried in the church yard of St. Peter's (at Oxford) in the
East, where is erected over his remains, a tomb, with an
inscription written by himself,</p>

frequently travelled into Holland and other parts, in search
of scarce books and valuable prints, and brought a vast
number into this kingdom, the greatest part of which were
purchased by the Earl of Oxford. He had been in his younger
days a shoemaker; and, for the many curiosities wherewith he
enriched the famous library of Dr. John Moore, Bishop of
Ely, his Lordship got him admitted into the Charter House.
He died in 1706, aged 65: after his death Lord Oxford
purchased all his collections and papers, for his library:
these are now in the Harleian collection in the British
Museum. In 1707 were published, in the Philosophical
Transactions, his Proposals for a General History of
Printing."&mdash;Bowyer and Nichols's <i>Origin of Printing</i>, p.
164, 189, note.
</p><p>
It has been my fortune (whether good or bad remains to be
proved) not only to transcribe the slender memorial of
Printing in the Philosophical Transactions, drawn up by
Wanley for Bagford, but to wade through <i>forty-two</i> folio
volumes, in which Bagford's materials for a History of
Printing are incorporated, in the British Museum: and from
these, I think I have furnished myself with a pretty fair
idea of the said Bagford. He was the most hungry and
rapacious of all book and print collectors; and, in his
ravages, spared neither the most delicate nor costly
specimens. His eyes and his mouth seem to have been always
open to express his astonishment at, sometimes, the most
common and contemptible productions; and his paper in the
Philosophical Transactions betrays such simplicity and
ignorance that one is astonished how my Lord Oxford and the
learned Bishop of Ely could have employed so credulous a
bibliographical forager. A modern collector and lover of
<i>perfect</i> copies will witness, with shuddering, among
Bagford's immense collection of Title Pages, in the Museum,
the frontispieces of the Complutensian Polyglot, and
Chauncy's History of Hertfordshire, torn out to illustrate a
History of Printing. His enthusiasm, however, carried him
through a great deal of laborious toil; and he supplied, in
some measure, by this qualification, the want of other
attainments. His whole mind was devoted to book-hunting; and
his integrity and diligence probably made his employers
overlook his many failings. His hand-writing is scarcely
legible, and his orthography is still more wretched; but if
he was ignorant, he was humble, zealous, and grateful; and
he has certainly done something towards the accomplishment
of that desirable object, an accurate General History of
Printing. In my edition of <i>Ames's Typographical
Antiquities</i>, I shall give an analysis of Bagford's papers,
with a specimen or two of his composition.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_16_17" id="Footnote_16_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_17">[16]</a> For an eloquent account of this disorder
consult the letters of Dr. Mosely inserted in the Morning
Herald of last year. I have always been surprised, and a
little vexed, that these animated pieces of composition
should be relished and praised by every one&mdash;but <i>the
Faculty</i>!</p></div>

<p class="tp">Let us enquire, therefore, into the origin and tendency of the
<span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>.</p>

<p>In this enquiry I purpose considering the subject under three points
of view: I. <span class="smcap">The History of the Disease</span>; or an account of the eminent
men who have fallen victims to it: II. <span class="smcap">The Nature, or Symptoms of the
Disease</span>: and III. <span class="smcap">The probable means of its Cure</span>. We are to consider,
then,</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The History of the Disease.</span> In treating of the history of this
disease, it will be found to have been attended with this remarkable
circumstance; namely, that it has almost uniformly confined its
attacks to the <i>male</i> sex, and, among these, to people in the higher
and middling classes of society, while the artificer, labourer, and
peasant have escaped wholly uninjured. It has raged chiefly in
palaces, castles, halls, and gay mansions; and those things which in
general are supposed not to be inimical to health, such as
cleanliness, spaciousness, and splendour, are only so many inducements
towards the introduction and propagation of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>! What
renders it particularly formidable is that it rages in all seasons of
the year, and at all periods of human existence. The emotions of
friendship or of love are weakened or subdued as old age advances; but
the influence of this passion, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_12" id="Page_B_12">B. 12</a></span> rather disease, admits of no
mitigation: "it grows with our growth, and strengthens with our
strength;" and is oft-times</p>

<p class="centerbp">&mdash;&mdash;The ruling passion strong in death.<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_17_18" id="Footnote_17_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_18">[17]</a> The writings of the Roman philologers seem to
bear evidence of this fact. Seneca, when an old man, says
that, "if you are fond of books, you will escape the ennui
of life; you will neither sigh for evening, disgusted with
the occupations of the day&mdash;nor will you live dissatisfied
with yourself, or unprofitable to others." <i>De
Tranquilitate</i>, ch. 3. Cicero has positively told us that
"study is the food of youth, and the amusement of old age."
<i>Orat. pro Archia</i>. The younger Pliny was a downright
Bibliomaniac. "I am quite transported and comforted," says
he, "in the midst of my books: they give a zest to the
happiest, and assuage the anguish of the bitterest, moments
of existence! Therefore, whether distracted by the cares or
the losses of my family, or my friends, I fly to my library
as the only refuge in distress: here I learn to bear
adversity with fortitude." <i>Epist.</i> lib. viii. cap. 19. But
consult Cicero <i>De Senectute</i>. All these treatises afford
abundant proof of the hopelessness of cure in cases of the
Bibliomania.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">We will now, my dear Sir, begin "making out the catalogue" of victims
to the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>! The first eminent character who appears to have
been infected with this disease was <span class="smcap">Richard De Bury</span>, one of the tutors
of Edward III., and afterwards Bishop of Durham; a man who has been
uniformly praised for the variety of his erudition, and the
intenseness of his ardour in book-collecting.<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> I discover no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_13" id="Page_B_13">B. 13</a></span>
notorious example of the fatality of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> until the time of
Henry VII.; when the monarch himself may be considered as having added
to the number. Although our venerable typographer, Caxton, lauds and
magnifies, with equal sincerity, the whole line of British Kings, from
Edward IV. to Henry VII. [under whose patronage he would seem, in some
measure, to have carried on his printing business], yet, of all these
monarchs, the latter alone was so unfortunate as to fall a victim to
this disease. His library must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_14" id="Page_B_14">B. 14</a></span> been a magnificent one, if we may
judge from the splendid specimens of it which now remain.<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It would
appear, too, that, about this time, the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> was increased by
the introduction of foreign printed books; and it is not very
improbable that a portion of Henry's immense wealth was devoted
towards the purchase of <span class="smcap">vellum</span> copies, which were now beginning to be
published by the great typographical triumvirate, Verard, Eustace, and
Pigouchet.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_18_19" id="Footnote_18_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_19">[18]</a> It may be expected that I should notice a few
book-lovers, and probably <span class="smcap">Bibliomaniacs</span>, previously to the
time of Richard De Bury; but so little is known with
accuracy of Johannes Scotus Erigena, and his patron Charles
the Bald, King of France, or of the book tête-a-têtes they
used to have together&mdash;so little, also, of Nennius, Bede,
and Alfred [although the monasteries at this period, from
the evidence of Sir William Dugdale, in the first volume of
the Monasticon were "opulently endowed,"&mdash;inter alia, I
should hope, with magnificent MSS. on vellum, bound in
velvet, and embossed with gold and silver], or the
illustrious writers in the Norman period, and the fine books
which were in the abbey of Croyland&mdash;so little is known of
book-collectors, previously to the 14th century, that I
thought it the most prudent and safe way to begin with the
above excellent prelate.
</p><p>
<span class="smcap">Richard De Bury</span> was the friend and correspondent of
Petrarch; and is said by Mons. de Sade, in his Memoires pour
la vie de Petrarque, "to have done in England what Petrarch
did all his life in France, Italy, and Germany, towards the
discovery of MSS. of the best ancient writers, and making
copies of them under his own superintendence." His passion
for book-collecting was unbounded ["vir ardentis ingenii,"
says Petrarch of him]; and in order to excite the same
ardour in his countrymen, or rather to propagate the disease
of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> with all his might, he composed a
bibliographical work under the title of <i>Philobiblion</i>;
concerning the first edition of which, printed at Spires in
1483, Clement (tom. v. 142) has a long gossiping account;
and Morhof tells us that it is "rarissima et in paucorum
manibus versatur." It was reprinted in Paris in 1500, 4to.,
by the elder Ascensius, and frequently in the subsequent
century, but the best editions of it are those by Goldastus
in 1674, 8vo., and Hummius in 1703. Morhof observes that,
"however De Bury's work savours of the rudeness of the age,
it is rather elegantly written, and many things are well
said in it relating to Bibliothecism." <i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>
vol. i. 187, edit. 1747.
</p><p>
For further particulars concerning De Bury, read Bale,
Wharton, Cave, and Godwin's Episcopal Biography. He left
behind him a fine library of MSS. which he bequeathed to
Durham, now Trinity, College, Oxford.
</p><p>
It may be worth the antiquary's notice, that, in consequence
(I suppose) of this amiable prelate's exertions, "in every
convent was a noble library and a great: and every friar,
that had state in school, such as they be now, hath <span class="smcap">an hugh
Library</span>." See the curious Sermon of the Archbishop of
Armagh, Nov. 8, 1387, in Trevisa's works among the <i>Harleian
MSS.</i> N<span class="super">o</span>. 1900. Whether these Friars, thus affected with
the frensy of book-collecting, ever visited the "old
chapelle at the Est End of the church of S. Saink
[Berkshire], whither of late time resorted in pilgrimage
many folkes for the disease of <i>madness</i>," [see Leland's
<i>Itinerary</i>, vol. ii. 29, edit. 1770] I have not been able,
after the most diligent investigation, to ascertain.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_19_20" id="Footnote_19_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_20">[19]</a> The British Museum contains a great number of
books which bear the royal stamp of Henry VII.'s arms. Some
of these printed by Verard, <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>, are magnificent
memorials of a library, the dispersion of which is for ever
to be regretted. As Henry VIII. knew nothing of, and cared
less for, fine books, it is not very improbable that some of
the choicest volumes belonging to the late king were
presented to Cardinal Wolsey.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">During the reign of Henry VIII., I should suppose that the Earl of
Surrey<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and Sir Thomas Wyatt were a little attached to
book-collecting; and that Dean Colet<a name="FNanchor_21_23" id="FNanchor_21_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_23" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and his friend Sir Thomas
More and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_15" id="Page_B_15">B. 15</a></span> Erasmus were downright Bibliomaniacs. There can be little

Bale,<a name="FNanchor_23_25" id="FNanchor_23_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_25" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> were able to escape the contagion; and that, in the ensuing
period, <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Roger">Rogar</span> Ascham became notorious for
the Book-disease. He purchased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_17" id="Page_B_17">B. 17</a></span> probably, during his travels
abroad<a name="FNanchor_24_26" id="FNanchor_24_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_26" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> many a fine copy of the Greek and Latin Classics, from
which he read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_18" id="Page_B_18">B. 18</a></span> to his illustrious pupils, Lady Jane Grey, and Queen
Elizabeth: but whether he made use of an <i>Editio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_19" id="Page_B_19">B. 19</a></span> Princeps</i>, or a
<i>Large paper copy</i>, I have hitherto not been lucky enough to discover.
This learned cha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_20" id="Page_B_20">B. 20</a></span>racter died in the vigour of life, and in the bloom
of reputation: and, as I suspect, in consequence of the
<span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>&mdash;for he was always collecting books, and always studying

emuntur et passim leguntur</i>!" The entire epistle (which may
be seen in Dr. Knight's dry Life of Colet, p. 315) is
devoted to an account of Erasmus's publications. "I am
really astonished, my dear Erasmus [does he exclaim], at the
fruitfulness of your talents; that, without any fixed
residence, and with a precarious and limited income, you
contrive to publish so many and such excellent works."
Adverting to the distracted state of Germany at this period,
and to the wish of his friend to live secluded and
unmolested, he observes&mdash;"As to the tranquil retirement
which you sigh for, be assured that you have my sincere
wishes for its rendering you as happy and composed as you
can wish it. Your age and erudition entitle you to such a
retreat. I fondly hope, indeed, that you will choose this
country for it, and come and live amongst us, whose
disposition you know, and whose friendship you have proved."

There is hardly a more curious picture of the custom of the
times, relating to the education of boys, than the Dean's
own Statutes for the regulation of St. Paul's School, which
he had founded. These shew, too, the <i>popular books</i> then
read by the learned. "The children shall come unto the
School in the morning at seven of the clock, both winter and
summer, and tarry there until eleven; and return against one
of the clock, and depart at five, &amp;c. In the school, no time
in the year, they shall use tallow candle in no wise, but
<i>only wax candle</i>, at the costs of their friends. Also I
will they bring no meat nor drink, nor bottle, nor use in
the school no breakfasts, nor drinkings, in the time of
learning, in no wise, &amp;c. I will they use no cockfightings,
nor riding about of victory, nor disputing at Saint
Bartholomew, which is but foolish babbling and loss of
time." The master is then restricted, under the penalty of
40 shillings, from granting the boys a holiday, or "remedy,"
[play-day,] as it is here called "except the King, an
Archbishop, or a Bishop, present in his own person in the
school, desire it." The studies for the lads were,
"Erasmus's Copia &amp; Institutum Christiani Hominis (composed
at the Dean's request) Lactantius, Prudentius, Juvencus,
Proba and Sedulius, and Baptista Mantuanus, and such other
as shall be thought convenient and most to purpose unto the
true Latin speech: all barbary, all corruption, all Latin
adulterate, which ignorant blind fools brought into this
world, and with the same hath distained and poisoned the old
Latin speech, and the <i>veray</i> Roman tongue, which in the
time of Tully and Sallust and Virgil and Terence was used&mdash;I
say that filthiness, and all such abusion, which the later
blind world brought in, which more rather may be called
<i>Bloterature</i> <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: than">that</span> [] <i>Literature</i>,
I utterly banish and exclude out of this school." <i>Life of

What was to be expected, but that boys, thus educated, would
hereafter fall victims to the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>?</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_22_24" id="Footnote_22_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_24">[22]</a> The history of this great
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: man">men</span>, and of his literary labours, is most
interesting. He was a pupil of William Lilly, the first
head-master of St. Paul's School; and, by the kindness and
liberality of a Mr. Myles, he afterwards received the
advantage of a College education, and was supplied with
money in order to travel abroad, and make such collections
as he should deem necessary for the great work which even
then seemed to dawn upon his young and ardent mind. Leland
endeavoured to requite the kindness of his benefactor by an
elegant copy of Latin verses, in which he warmly expatiates
on the generosity of his patron, and acknowledges that his
acquaintance with the <i>Almæ Matres</i> [for he was of both
Universities] was entirely the result of such beneficence.
While he resided on the continent, he was admitted into the
society of the most eminent Greek and Latin Scholars, and
could probably number among his correspondents the
illustrious names of Budæus, Erasmus, the Stephani, Faber
and Turnebus. Here, too, he cultivated his natural taste for
poetry; and from inspecting the fine <span class="smcap">books</span> which the Italian
and French presses had produced, as well as fired by the
love of Grecian learning, which had fled, on the sacking of
Constantinople, to take shelter in the academic bowers of
the Medici, he seems to have matured his plans for carrying
into effect the great work which had now taken full
possession of his mind. He returned to England, resolved to
institute an inquiry into the state of the <span class="smcap">Libraries</span>,
Antiquities, Records and Writings then in existence. Having
entered into holy orders, and obtained preferment at the
express interposition of the King, (Henry VIII.), he was
appointed his Antiquary and Library Keeper, and a royal
commission was issued in which Leland was directed to search
after "<span class="smcap">England's Antiquities</span>, and peruse the <span class="smcap">libraries</span> of
all Cathedrals, Abbies, Priories, Colleges, etc., as also
all the places wherein Records, Writings, and Secrets of
Antiquity were reposited." "Before Leland's time," says
Hearne, in the Preface to the Itinerary, "all the literary
monuments of Antiquity were totally disregarded; and
Students of Germany, apprised of this culpable indifference,
were suffered to enter our libraries unmolested, and to cut
out of the books deposited there whatever passages they
thought proper&mdash;which they afterwards published as relics of
the ancient literature of their own country."
</p><p>
Leland was occupied, without intermission, in this immense
undertaking, for the space of six years; and, on its
completion, he hastened to the metropolis to lay at the feet
of his Sovereign the result of his researches. This was
presented to Henry under the title of <span class="smcap">A New Year's Gift</span>; and
was first published by Bale in 1549, 8vo. "Being inflamed,"
says the author, "with a love to see thoroughly all those
parts of your opulent and ample realm, in so much that all
my other occupations intermitted, I have so travelled in
your dominions, both by the sea coasts and the middle parts,
sparing neither labour nor costs, by the space of six years
past, that there is neither cape nor bay, haven, creek, or
pier, river, or confluence of rivers, breeches, wastes,
lakes, moors, fenny waters, mountains, vallies, heaths,
forests, chases, woods, cities, burghes, castles, principal
manor places, monasteries and colleges, but I have seen
them; and noted, in so doing, a whole world of things very
memorable." Leland moreover tells his Majesty&mdash;that "By his
laborious journey and costly enterprise, he had conserved
many good authors, the which otherwise had been like to have
perished; of the which, part remained in the royal palaces,
part also in his own custody, &amp;c."
</p><p>
As Leland was engaged six years in this literary tour, so he
was occupied for a no less period of time in digesting and
arranging the prodigious number of MSS. he had collected.
But he sunk beneath the immensity of the task! The want of
amanuenses, and of other attentions and comforts, seems to
have deeply affected him; in this melancholy state, he wrote
to Archbishop Cranmer a Latin epistle, in verse, of which
the following is the commencement&mdash;very forcibly describing
his situation and anguish of mind.</p>

<p>The result was that Leland lost his senses; and, after
lingering two years in a state of total derangement, he died
on the 18th of April, 1552. "Prôh tristes rerum humanarum
vices! prôh viri optimi deplorandam infelicissimamque
sortem!" exclaims Dr. Smith, in his preface to Camden's
Life, 1691, 4to.
</p><p>
The precious and voluminous MSS. of Leland were doomed to
suffer a fate scarcely less pitiable than that of their
owner. After being pilfered by some, and garbled by others,
they served to replenish the pages of Stow, Lambard, Camden,
Burton, Dugdale, and many other antiquaries and historians.
Polydore Virgil, who had stolen from them pretty freely, had
the insolence to abuse Leland's memory&mdash;calling him "a vain
glorious man;" but what shall we say to this flippant
egotist? who, according to Caius's testimony [<i>De Antiq.
Cantab. head. lib.</i> 1.] "to prevent a discovery of the many
errors of his own History of England, collected and burnt a
greater number of ancient histories and manuscripts than
would have loaded a waggon." The imperfect remains of
Leland's MSS. are now deposited in the Bodleian Library, and
in the British Museum.
</p><p>
Upon the whole, it must be acknowledged that Leland is a
melancholy, as well as illustrious, example of the influence
of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_23_25" id="Footnote_23_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_25">[23]</a> In spite of <span class="smcap">Bale's</span> coarseness, positiveness,
and severity, he has done much towards the cause of
learning; and, perhaps, towards the propagation of the
disease under discussion. His regard for Leland does him
great honour; and although his plays are miserably dull,
notwithstanding the high prices which the original editions
of them bear, (vide ex. gr. Cat. Steevens, N<span class="super">o</span>. 1221;
which was sold for £12 12<i>s.</i> See also the reprints in the
Harleian Miscellany) the lover of literary antiquities must
not forget that his "<i>Scriptores Britanniæ</i>" are yet quoted
with satisfaction by some of the most respectable writers of
the day. That he wanted delicacy of feeling, and
impartiality of investigation, must be admitted; but a
certain rough honesty and prompt benevolence which he had
about him compensated for a multitude of offences. The
abhorrence with which he speaks of the dilapidation of some
of our old libraries must endear his memory to every honest
bibliographer: "Never (says he) had we been offended for the
loss of our <span class="smcap">Libraries</span>, being so many in number, and in so
desolate places for the more part, if the chief monuments
and most notable works of our excellent writers had been
reserved. If there had been in every shire of England, but
one <span class="smcap">solempne Library</span>, to the preservation of those noble
works, and preferment of good learning in our posterity, it
had been yet somewhat. But to destroy all without
consideration, is, and will be, unto England for ever, a
most horrible infamy among the grave seniors of other
nations. A great number of them which purchased those
superstitious mansions, reserved of those library-books,
some to serve the <i>jakes</i>, some to scour their candlesticks,
and some to rub their boots: some they sold to the grocers
and soap-sellers; some they sent over sea to the
book-binders, not in small number, but at times whole ships
full, to the wondering of the foreign nations. Yea, the
Universities of this realm are not all clear of this
detestable fact. But cursed is that belly which seeketh to
be fed with such ungodly gain, and shameth his natural
country. I know a merchant man, which shall at this time be
nameless, that <i>bought the contents of two noble libraries
for forty shillings price</i>; a shame it is to be spoken! This
stuff hath he occupied in the stead of grey paper, by the
space of more than ten years, and yet he hath store enough
for as many year to come!" Bale's Preface to Leland's

Bale. Anno M.D. xlix. 8vo.

<p class="tbp">If we are to judge from the beautiful Missal lying open before Lady
Jane Grey, in Mr. Copley's elegant picture now exhibiting at the
British Institution, it would seem rational to infer that this amiable
and learned female was slightly attacked by the disease. It is to be
taken for granted that Queen Elizabeth was not exempt from it; and
that her great Secretary,<a name="FNanchor_25_27" id="FNanchor_25_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_27" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Cecil, sympathised with her! In regard

me that she found the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> irresistible! During her reign, how
vast and how frightful were the ravages of the Book-madness! If we are
to credit Laneham's celebrated Letter, it had extended far into the
country, and infected some of the worthy inhabitants of Coventry; for
one "Captain Cox,<a name="FNanchor_27_29" id="FNanchor_27_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_29" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> by profession a mason, and that right skilful,"
had "as fair a library of sciences, and as many goodly monuments both

But whoever looks at Elizabeth's portrait, on her bended
knees, struck off on the reverse of the title page to her
prayer book (first printed in 1565) may suppose that the
Queen thought the addition of her own portrait would be no
mean decoration to the work. Every page is adorned with
borders, engraved on wood, of the most spirited execution:
representing, amongst other subjects, "The Dance of Death."

library, enriched with many treasures from the Queen of Sweden's,
which this versatile genius scrupled not to pillage without confession
or apology. During this century our great reasoners and philosophers
began to be in motion; and, like the fumes of tobacco, which drive the
concealed and clotted insects from the interior to the extremity of
the leaves, the infectious particles of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> set a thousand

<p><a name="Footnote_31_33" id="Footnote_31_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_33">[31]</a> Of <span class="smcap">Michael Maittaire</span> I have given a brief
sketch in my Introduction to the <i>Greek and Latin Classics</i>,
vol. I, 148. Mr. Beloe, in the 3rd vol. of his <i>Anecdotes of
Literature</i>, p. ix., has described his merits with justice.
The principal value of Maittaire's <i>Annales Typographici</i>
consists in a great deal of curious matter detailed in the
notes; but the absence of the "lucidus ordo" renders the
perusal of these fatiguing and dissatisfactory. The author
brought a full and well-informed mind to the task he
undertook&mdash;but he wanted taste and precision in the
arrangement of his materials. The eye wanders over a vast
indigested mass; and information, when it is to be acquired
with excessive toil, is, comparatively, seldom acquired.
Panzer has adopted an infinitely better plan, on the model
of Orlandi; and, if his materials had been <i>printed</i> with
the same beauty with which they appear to have been
composed, and his annals had descended to as late a period
as those of Maittaire, his work must have made us,
eventually, forget that of his predecessor. The
bibliographer is, no doubt, aware that of Maittaire's first
volume there are two editions. Why the author did not
reprint, in the second edition (1733), the facsimile of the
epigram and epistle of <span class="smcap">Lascar</span> prefixed to the edition of the
Anthology 1496, and the disquisition concerning the ancient
editions of Quintilian (both of which were in the first
edition of 1719), is absolutely inexplicable. Maittaire was
sharply attacked for this absurdity, in the "Catalogus
Auctorum," of the "<i>Annus Tertius Sæcularis Inv. Art.
Topog.</i>" Harlem, 1741, 8vo. p. 11. "Rara certe Librum
augendi methodus (exclaims the author)! Satis patet auctorem
hoc eo fecisse consilio, ut et primæ et secundæ Libri sive

The catalogue of Maittaire's library [1748, 2 parts, 8vo.],
which affords ample proof of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> of its
collector, is exceedingly scarce. A good copy of it, even
unpriced, is worth a guinea: it was originally sold for 4
shillings; and was drawn up by Maittaire himself.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_32_34" id="Footnote_32_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_34">[32]</a> In a periodical publication called "<i>The
Director</i>," to which I contributed under the article of
"<i>Bibliographiana</i>" (and of which the printer of this work,
Mr. William Savage, is now the sole publisher), there was
rather a minute analysis of the famous library of <span class="smcap">Harley,
Earl of Oxford</span>: a library which seems not only to have
revived, but eclipsed, the splendour of the Roman one formed
by Lucullus. The following is an abridgement of this

<p>Mr. Gough says, these books "filled thirteen handsome
chambers, and two long galleries." Osborne the bookseller
purchased them for £13,000: a sum little more than two
thirds of the price of the binding, as paid by Lord Oxford.
The bookseller was accused of injustice and parsimony; but
the low prices which he afterwards affixed to the articles,
and the tardiness of their sale, are sufficient refutations
of this charge. Osborne opened his shop for the inspection
of the books on Tuesday the 14th of February, 1744; for fear
"of the curiosity of the spectators, before the sale,
producing disorder in the disposition of the books." The
dispersion of the <span class="smcap">Harleian Collection</span> is a blot in the
literary annals of our country: had there then been such a
Speaker, and such a spirit in the House of Commons, as we
now possess, the volumes of Harley would have been reposing
with the <span class="smcap">marbles of Townley</span>!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_33_35" id="Footnote_33_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_35">[33]</a> "<span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Smithiana</span>: sive Catalogus

et Bibliothecæ ornamentum multo ære sibi comparavit vir
clarissimus doctissimusque D. <span class="smcap">Richardus Smith</span>, &amp;c., Londini,
1682," 4to. I recommend the collector of curious and
valuable catalogues to lay hold upon the present one (of
which a more particular description will be given in another
work) whenever it comes in his way. The address "To the
Reader," in which we are told that "this so much celebrated,
so often desired, so long expected, library is now exposed
to sale," gives a very interesting account of the owner.
Inter alia, we are informed that Mr. Smith "was as
constantly known every day to walk his rounds through the
shops, as to sit down to his meals, &amp;c.;" and that "while
others were forming arms, and new-modelling kingdoms, <i>his</i>
great ambition was to become master of a good book."
</p><p>
The catalogue itself justifies every thing said in
commendation of the collector of the library. The
arrangement is good; the books, in almost all departments of
literature, foreign and domestic, valuable and curious; and
among the English ones I have found some of the rarest
Caxtons to refer to in my edition of Ames. What would Mr.
Bindley, or Mr. Malone, or Mr. Douce, give to have the
<i>creaming</i> of such a collection of "Bundles of Stitcht Books
and Pamphlets," as extends from page 370 to 395 of this
catalogue! But alas! while the Bibliographer exults in, or
hopes for, the possession of such treasures, the
physiologist discovers therein fresh causes of disease, and
the philanthropist mourns over the ravages of the
<span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>!</p>

Let any person examine the catalogue of <i>Forty-two</i> folio
volumes of "MS. collections by Mr. Baker," (as given at the
end of this piece of biography) and reconcile himself, if he
can, to the supposition that the said Mr. Baker did not fall
a victim to the <i>Book-disease</i>! For some cause, I do not now
recollect what, Baker took his name off the books of St.
John's College, Cambridge, to which he belonged; but such
was his attachment to the place, and more especially to the
library, that he spent a great portion of the ensuing twenty
years of his life within the precincts of the same:
frequently comforted and refreshed, no doubt, by the sight
of the magnificent <span class="smcap">large paper</span> copies of Walton and Castell,
and of Cranmer's Bible <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_35_37" id="Footnote_35_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_37">[35]</a> This <span class="smcap">Thomas Rawlinson</span>, who is introduced in
the Tatler under the name <i>Tom Folio</i>, was a very
extraordinary character, and most desperately addicted to
book-hunting. Because his own house was not large enough, he
hired <i>London House</i>, in Aldersgate Street, for the
reception of his library; and here he used to regale himself
with the sight and the scent of innumerable black letter
volumes, arranged in "sable garb," and stowed perhaps "three
deep," from the bottom to the top of his house. He died in
1725; and Catalogues of his books for sale continued, for
nine succeeding years, to meet the public eye. The following
is a list of all the parts which I have ever met with; taken
from copies in Mr. Heber's possession.

<p>Two different catalogues of this valuable collection of
books were printed. The one was analysed, or a <i>catalogue
raisonné</i>; to which was prefixed a print of a Grecian
portico, &amp;c., with ornaments and statues: the other
(expressly for the sale) was an indigested and extremely
confused one&mdash;to which was prefixed a print, designed and
engraved by A. Motte, of an oak felled, with a number of men
cutting down and carrying away its branches; illustrative of
the following Greek motto inscribed on a scroll
above&mdash;<span lang="el" title="Greek: Dryos pesousês pas anêr xyleuetai">&#916;&#961;&#965;&#8056;&#962;

affecting memento (says Mr. Nichols, very justly, in his
<i>Anecdotes of Bowyer</i>, p. 557) to the collectors of great

accessible repository."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_37_39" id="Footnote_37_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_39">[37]</a> In the year 1730-1, there was sold by auction,
at St. Paul's Coffee-house, in St. Paul's Church-yard
(beginning every evening at five o'clock), the library of
the celebrated Free-Thinker,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anthony Collins, Esq.</span></p>

<p>"Containing a collection of several thousand volumes in
Greek, Latin, English, French, and Spanish; in divinity,
history, antiquity, philosophy, husbandry, and all polite
literature: and especially many curious travels and voyages;
and many rare and valuable pamphlets." This collection,
which is divided into <i>two parts</i> (the first containing 3451
articles, the second 3442), is well worthy of being
consulted by the theologian, who is writing upon any
controverted point of divinity: there are articles in it of
the rarest occurrence. The singular character of its owner
and of his works is well known: he was at once the friend
and the opponent of Locke and Clarke, who were both anxious
for the conversion of a character of such strong, but
misguided, talents. The former, on his death-bed, wrote
Collins a letter to be delivered to him, after his decease,
which was full of affection and good advice.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_38_40" id="Footnote_38_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_40">[38]</a> It is almost impossible to dwell on the memory
of this <span class="smcap">great man</span> without emotions of delight&mdash;whether we
consider him as an eminent physician, a friend to
literature, or a collector of books, pictures, and coins.
Benevolence, magnanimity, and erudition were the striking
features of his character: his house was the general
receptacle of men of genius and talent, and of every thing
beautiful, precious, or rare. His curiosities, whether
books, or coins, or pictures, were freely laid open to the
public; and the enterprising student, and experienced
antiquary, alike found amusement and a courteous reception.
He was known to all foreigners of intellectual distinction,
and corresponded both with the artisan and the potentate.
The great patron of literature, and the leader of his
profession (which he practised with a success unknown
before), it was hardly possible for unbefriended merit, if
properly introduced to him, to depart unrewarded. The
clergy, and in general, all men of learning, received his
advice <i>gratuitously</i>: and his doors were open every morning
to the <i>most indigent</i>, whom he frequently assisted with
money. Although his income, from his professional practice,
was very considerable, he died by no means a rich man&mdash;so
large were the sums which he devoted to the encouragement of
literature and the fine arts!
</p><p>
The sale of Dr. Mead's <i>books</i> commenced on the 18th of
November, 1754, and again on the 7th of April, 1755: lasting
together 57 days. The sale of the <i>prints</i> and <i>drawings</i>
continued 14 nights. The <i>gems</i>, <i>bronzes</i>, <i>busts</i>, and
<i>antiquities</i>, 8 days.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to mention, within a moderate compass,
all the rare and curious articles which his library
contained&mdash;but the following are too conspicuous to be
passed over. The <i>Spira Virgil</i> of 1470, <i>Pfintzing's
Tewrkdrancs</i>, 1527, <i>Brandt's Stultifera Navis</i>, 1498, and
the <i>Aldine Petrarch</i> of 1501, <span class="smcap">all upon vellum</span>. The large
paper <i>Olivet's Cicero</i> was purchased by Dr. Askew for £14
14<i>s.</i> and was sold again at his sale for £36 15<i>s.</i> The
King of France bought the editio princeps of <i>Pliny Senr.</i>
for £11 11<i>s.</i>; and Mr. Willock, a bookseller, bought the
magnificently illuminated <i>Pliny by Jenson</i> of 1472, for £18
18<i>s.</i>: of which Maittaire has said so many fine things. The
<i>French</i> books, and all the works upon the <i>Fine Arts</i>, were
of the first rarity, and value, and bound in a sumptuous
manner. Winstanley's <i>Prospects of Audley End</i> brought £50.
An amusing account of some of the pictures will be found in
Mr. Beloe's "<i>Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books</i>,"
vol. i. 166. 71. But consult also <i>Nichol's Anecdotes of
Bowyer</i>, p. 225, &amp;c. Of the catalogue of Dr. Mead's books
there were only six copies printed on <span class="smcap">large paper</span>. See Bibl.

severely and how mortally he suffered from it.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_39_41" id="Footnote_39_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_41">[39]</a> "A Catalogue of the entire and valuable
library of <span class="smcap">Martin Folkes, Esq.</span>, President of the Royal
Society, and member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at
Paris, lately deceased; which will be sold by auction by
Samuel Baker, at his house, in York Street, Covent Garden.
To begin on Monday, February 2, 1756, and to continue for
forty days successively (Sundays excepted). Catalogues to be
had at most of the considerable places in Europe, and all
the booksellers of Great Britain and Ireland, Price
Sixpence."
</p><p>
This collection was an exceedingly fine one; enriched with
many books of the choicest description, which Mr. Folkes had
acquired in his travels in Italy and Germany. The works on
natural history, coins, medals, and inscriptions, and on the
fine arts in general, formed the most valuable
department&mdash;those in the Greek, Latin and English classics,
were comparatively of inferior importance. It is a great
pity the catalogue was not better digested; or the books
classed according to the nature of their contents.
</p><p>
The following prices, for some of the more rare and
interesting articles, will amuse a bibliographer of the
present day. The chronicles of Fabian, Hall, and Grafton,
did not altogether bring quite £2: though the copies are
described as perfect and fair. There seems to have been a
fine set of Sir Wm. Dugdale's Works (Nos. 3074-81) in 13
vols. which, collectively, produced about 30 guineas.
</p><p>
In <i>Spanish literature</i>, the history of South America, By
Don Juan and Ant. di Ulloa, Madr. fol. in 5 vols., was sold
for £5: a fine large paper copy of the description of the
Monastery of St. Lorenzo, and the Escorial, Madr. 1657,
brought £1 2<i>s.</i>: de Lastanosa's Spanish Medals, Huesca,
fol. 1645, £2 2<i>s.</i>
</p><p>
In <i>English</i>, the first edition of Shakespeare, 1623, which
is now what a French bibliographer would say "presque
introuvable," produced the sum of £3 3<i>s.</i>; and Fuller's
Worthies, 18<i>s.</i>!
</p><p>
<i>Fine Arts, Antiquities, and Voyages.</i> Sandrart's works, in
9 folio volumes (of which a fine perfect copy is now rarely
to be met with, and of very great value) were sold for £13
13<i>s.</i> only: Desgodetz Roman edifices, Paris, 1682, £4
10<i>s.</i>: Galleria Giustiniano, 2 vols., fol. £13 13<i>s.</i> Le
Brun's Voyages in Muscovy, &amp;c., in large paper, £4 4<i>s.</i> De
Rossi's Raccolta de Statue, &amp;c. Rom. 1704, £6 10<i>s.</i>
Medailles du Regne de Louis le Grand, de l'imp. Roy. 1. p.
fol. 1702, £5 15<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
</p><p>
The works on <i>Natural History</i> brought still higher prices;
but the whole, from the present depreciation of specie, and
increased rarity of the articles, would now bring thrice the
sums then given.
</p><p>
Of the <i>Greek and Latin Classics</i>, the Pliny of 1469 and
1472 were sold to Dr. Askew for £11 11<i>s.</i> and £7 17<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> At the Doctor's sale they brought £43 and £23:
although the first was lately sold (A.D. 1805) among some
duplicates of books belonging to the British Museum, at a
much lower price: the copy was, in fact, neither large nor
beautiful. Those in the Hunter and Cracherode collections
are greatly superior, and would each bring more than double
the price.
</p><p>
From a priced copy of the sale catalogue, in my possession,
I find that the amount of the sale, consisting of 5126
articles, was £3091 5<i>s.</i>
</p><p>
The <i>Prints and Drawings</i> of Mr. Folkes occupied a sale of 8
days; and his <i>pictures</i>, <i>gems</i>, <i>coins</i>, and <i>mathematical
instruments</i>, of five days.
</p><p>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin Folkes</span> may justly be ranked among the most
useful, as well as splendid, literary characters of which
this country can boast. He appears to have imbibed, at a
very early age, an extreme passion for science and
literature; and to have distinguished himself so much at the
University of Cambridge, under the able tuition of Dr.
Laughton, that, in his 23rd year, he was admitted a Fellow
of the Royal Society. About two years afterwards he was
chosen one of the council, and rose, in gradual succession,
to the chair of the presidentship, which he filled with a
credit and celebrity that has since never been surpassed. On
this occasion he was told by Dr. Jurin, the Secretary, who
dedicated to him the 34th vol. of the Transactions, that
"the greatest man that ever lived (Sir Isaac Newton) singled
him out to fill the chair, and to preside in the society,
when he himself was so frequently prevented by
indisposition: and that it was sufficient to say of him that
he was <i>Sir Isaac's friend</i>."
</p><p>
Within a few years after this, he was elected President of
the Society of Antiquaries. Two situations, the filling of
which may be considered as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of literary
distinction. Mr. Folkes travelled abroad, with his family,
about two years and a half, visiting the cities of Rome,
Florence, and Venice&mdash;where he was noticed by almost every
person of rank and reputation, and whence he brought away
many a valuable article to enrich his own collection. He was
born in the year 1690, and died of a second stroke of the
palsy, under which he languished for three years, in 1754.
Dr. Birch has drawn a very just and interesting character of
this eminent man, which may be found in Nichol's <i>Anecdotes
of Bowyer</i>, 562. 7. Mr. Edwards, the late ornithologist, has
described him in a simple, but appropriate, manner. "He
seemed," says he, "to have attained to universal knowledge;
for, in the many opportunities I have had of being in his
company, almost every part of science has happened to be the
subject of discourse, all of which he handled as an adept.
He was a man of great politeness in his manners, free from
all pedantry and pride, and, in every respect, the real
unaffected fine gentleman."</p>

This valuable library must have contained about 20,000
volumes; for the number of Articles amounted to 9405. On
examining a priced catalogue of it, which now lies before
me, I have not found any higher sum offered for a work than
£4 1<i>s.</i> for a collection of fine prints, by Aldegrave (No.
9405). The Greek and Latin classics, of which there were few
<i>Editiones Principes</i>, or on <i>large paper</i>, brought the
usual sums given at that period. The old English
black-lettered books, which were pretty thickly scattered
throughout the collection, were sold for exceedingly low
prices&mdash;if the copies were perfect. Witness the following:</p>

<p>These are only very few of the rare articles in English
literature, of the whole of which (perhaps upwards of 200 in
number) I believe, the 'Boke of St. Albans,' brought the
highest sum. Hence it will be seen that this was not the age
of curious research into the productions of our ancestors.
Shakspeare had not then appeared in a proper <i>Variorum
edition</i>. Theobald, and Pope, and Warburton, had not
investigated the black-letter lore of ancient English
writers, for the illustration of their favourite author.
This was reserved for Farmer, for Steevens, for Malone, for
Chalmers, Reed and Douce: and it is expressly to these
latter gentlemen (for Johnson and Hanmer were very sparing,
or very shy, of the black letter), that we are indebted for
the present spirit of research into the works of our
ancestors.
</p><p>
The sale of the books lasted 50 days. There was a second
sale of pamphlets, books of prints, &amp;c., in the following
year, which lasted 10 days; and this was immediately
succeeded by a sale of the Doctor's single prints and
drawings, which continued 8 days.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_41_43" id="Footnote_41_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_43">[41]</a> This gentleman's library, not so remarkable
for the black letter as for whimsical publications, was sold
by auction, by Samuel Paterson, [the earliest sale in which
I find this well known book-auctioneer engaged] in June,
1759, and the three ensuing evenings. The title of the Sale
Catalogue is as follows:
</p><p>
"A Catalogue of the original MSS. and manuscript collections
of the late Reverend Mr. <span class="smcap">John Henley</span>, A.M., Independent
Minister of the Oratory, &amp;c., in which are included sundry
collections of the late Mons. des Maizeaux, the learned
editor of Bayle, &amp;c., Mr. Lowndes, author of the Report for
the Amendment of Silver Coins, &amp;c., Dr. Patrick Blair,
Physician at Boston, and F.R.S. &amp;c., together with original
letters and papers of State, addressed to Henry d'Avenant,
Esq., her Britannic Majesty's Envoy at Francfort, from 1703
to 1708 inclusive."
</p><p>
Few libraries have contained more curious and remarkable
publications than did this. The following articles, given as
notable specimens, remind us somewhat of Addison's Memoranda
for the Spectator, which the waiter at the coffee-house
picked up and read aloud for the amusement of the company.

<p class="tbp">We are now, my dear Sir, descending rapidly to our own times; and, in
a manner sufficiently rough, have traced the <i>History of the
Bibliomania</i> to the commencement of the present illustrious reign:
when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_32" id="Page_B_32">B. 32</a></span> we discover, among its victims, a General, who had probably
faced many a cannon, and stormed many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_33" id="Page_B_33">B. 33</a></span> rampart, uninjured. The name
of Dormer<a name="FNanchor_42_44" id="FNanchor_42_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_44" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> will remind you of the small but choice library which
affords such a melancholy proof of its owners' fate; while the more
splendid examples of Smith<a name="FNanchor_43_45" id="FNanchor_43_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_45" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and West<a name="FNanchor_44_46" id="FNanchor_44_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_46" class="fnanchor">[44]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_34" id="Page_B_34">B. 34</a></span> serve to shew the
increased ravages of a disease, which seemed to threaten the lives of
all, into whose ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_35" id="Page_B_35">B. 35</a></span> (like those of "Visto,") some demon had
"whispered" the sound of "<span class="smcap">taste</span>." These three striking instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_36" id="Page_B_36">B. 36</a></span> of
the fatality of the Bibliomania occurred&mdash;the first in the year 1764;
and the latter in 1773. The following year witnessed the sale of the
Fletewode<a name="FNanchor_45_47" id="FNanchor_45_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_47" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_37" id="Page_B_37">B. 37</a></span> library; so that nothing but despair and havoc appeared
to move in the train of this pestiferous malady. In the year 1775 died
the famous Dr. Anthony Askew, another illustrious victim to the
Bibliomania. Those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_38" id="Page_B_38">B. 38</a></span> who recollect the zeal and scholarship of this
great book-collector, and the precious gems with which his library<a name="FNanchor_46_48" id="FNanchor_46_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_48" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
was stored from the cabinets of De Boze and Gaignat, as well as of
Mead and Folkes, cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_39" id="Page_B_39">B. 39</a></span> but sigh with grief of heart on the thought
of such a victim! How ardently, and how kindly [as I remember to have
heard his friend Dr. Burges say], would Askew unfold his glittering
stores&mdash;open the magnificent folio, or the shining duodecimo, <span class="smcap">upon
vellum</span>, embossed and fast held together with golden knobs and silver
clasps! How carefully would he unroll the curious MS.&mdash;decipher the
half effaced characters&mdash;and then, casting an eye of ecstacy over the
shelves upon which similar treasures were lodged, exult in the
glittering prospect before him! But death&mdash;who, as Horace tells us,
raps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_40" id="Page_B_40">B. 40</a></span> equally at the palaces of kings and cottages of peasants, made
no scruple to exercise the knocker of the Doctor's door, and sent, as
his avant-courier, <span class="smcap">this deplorable mania</span>! It appeared; and even Askew,
with all his skill in medicine and books, fell lifeless before
it&mdash;bewailed, as he was beloved and respected!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_42_44" id="Footnote_42_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_44">[42]</a> "A Catalogue of the genuine and elegant
Library of the late Sir <span class="smcap">C.C. Dormer</span>, collected by
Lieutenant-General James Dormer, which will be sold, &amp;c., by
Samuel Baker, at his house in York Street, Covent Garden; to
begin on Monday, February the 20th, 1764, and to continue
the nineteen following evenings." At the end of the
catalogue we are told that the books were "in general of the
best editions, and in the finest condition, many of them in
<i>large paper</i>, bound in morocco, gilt leaves, &amp;c."
</p><p>
This was a very choice collection of books, consisting
almost entirely of Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish and
French. The number of articles did not exceed 3082, and of
volumes, probably not 7000. The catalogue is neatly printed,
and copies of it on <i>large paper</i> are exceedingly scarce.
Among the most curious and valuable articles were those
numbered 599, 604, 2249, 2590; from n<span class="super">o</span>. 2680, to the end,
was a choice collection of Italian and Spanish books.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_43_45" id="Footnote_43_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_45">[43]</a> In the year 1755 was published at Venice,
printed by J.B. Pasquali, a catalogue of the books of <span class="smcap">Joseph
Smith</span>, Esq., Consul at Venice.
</p><p>
The catalogue was published under the following Latin title:
"Bibliotheca Smitheana, seu Catalogus Librorum D. Josephi
Smithii, Angli, per Cognomina Authorum dispositus, Venetiis,
typis Jo. Baptistæ Pasquali, M,DCCLV.;" in quarto; with the
arms of Consul Smith. The title page is succeeded by a Latin
preface of Pasquali, and an alphabetical list of 43 pages of
the authors mentioned in the catalogue: then follow the
books arranged alphabetically, without any regard to size,
language, or subject. These occupy 519 pages, marked with
the Roman numerals; after which are 66 pages, numbered in
the same manner, of "addenda et corrigenda." The most
valuable part of the volume is "The Prefaces and Epistles
prefixed to those works in the Library which were printed in
the 15th century:" these occupy 348 pages. A Catalogue, (in
three pages) of the Names of the illustrious Men mentioned
in these prefaces, &amp;c., closes the book.
</p><p>
It would be superfluous to mention to bibliographers the
rare articles contained in this collection, which are so
generally known and so justly appreciated. They consist
chiefly of early editions of <i>Italian</i>, <i>Greek</i>, and <i>Latin
classics</i>; and of many copies of both printed <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>.
The library, so rich in these articles, was, however,
defective in English Literature and Antiquities. There was
scarcely any thing of Shakspeare or Dugdale.
</p><p>
On the death of Mr. Smith in 1772, his collection was sold
in 1773, 8vo., by Baker and Leigh; and the books were
announced to the public, as being "in the finest
preservation, and consisting of the very best and scarcest
editions of the Latin, Italian, and French authors, from the
invention of printing; with manuscripts and missals, upon
vellum, finely illuminated." A glance upon the prices for
which most of these fine books were sold made Mr. Cuthell
exclaim, in my hearing, that "<i>they were given away</i>." On
these occasions, one cannot help now and then wishing, with
father Evander,</p>

<p class="center">"O mihi præteritos referat si Jupiter annos!"</p>

<p>On comparing Pasquali's, with the sale, catalogue, it will
be obvious that a great number of rare and valuable articles
was disposed of before the books came to public auction.
Indeed it is known that his present <span class="smcap">Majesty</span> enriched his
magnificent collection with many of the Consul's <i>first
editions</i>, and <i>vellum copies</i>, during the life of the
latter. The sale continued thirteen days only; and on the
last day were sold all the English books in the
<i>black-letter</i>. Some of these are rather curious.
</p><p>
Of <span class="smcap">Consul Smith</span> I am unable to present the lover of <span class="smcap">virtu</span>
with any particulars more acceptable than the following.
Pasquali (whose Latin preface is curious enough&mdash;abounding
with as many interrogatories as Hamlet's soliloquies) has
told us that "as the Consul himself was distinguished for
his politeness, talents, and prudence, so was his house for
splendid and elegant decorations. You might there view, says
he, the most beautifully painted pictures, and exquisite
ornaments, whether gems, vases, or engravings. In short, the
whole furniture was so brilliant and classical that you
admired at once the magnificence and judgment of the owner."
He tells us, a little further, that he had frequently
solicited the Consul to print a catalogue of his books;
which proposition his modesty at first induced him to
reject; but, afterwards, his liberality, to comply with. He
then observes that, "in the compilation of the catalogue, he
has studied brevity as much as it was consistent with
perspicuity; and that he was once desirous of stating the
<i>value</i> and <i>price</i> of the books, but was dissuaded from it
by the advice of the more experienced, and by the singular
modesty of the Collector."
</p><p>
It must be confessed that Pasquali has executed his task
well, and that the catalogue ranks among the most valuable,
as well as rare, books of the kind.</p>

old English typographers. Digested by Samuel Paterson,"
1773, 8vo.
</p>

<p class="center">ANALYSIS OF THE CATALOGUE.</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Volumes of Miscellaneous Tracts.</i></p>

<p>These volumes extend from N<span class="super">o</span>. 148 to 200, from 915 to
992, from 1201 to 1330, and from N<span class="super">o</span>. 1401 to 1480.
</p>

<p class="center">2. <i>Divinity.</i></p>

<p>In the whole, 560 articles; probably about 1200 volumes;
some of them exceedingly scarce and valuable.
</p>

<p class="center">3. <i>Education, Languages, Criticism, Classics, Dictionaries,<br />
Catalogues of Libraries, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There were about 700 volumes in these departments. The
catalogues of English books, from that of Maunsell, in 1595,
to the latest before Mr. West's time, were very complete.
The treatises on education and translations of the ancient
classics comprehended a curious and uncommon collection. The
Greek and Latin classics were rather select than rare.
</p>

<p class="center">4. <i>English Poetry, Romance, and Miscellanies.</i></p>

<p>This interesting part of the collection comprehended about
355 articles, or probably about 750 volumes: and if the
singularly rare and curious books which may be found <i>under
these heads alone</i> were now concentrated in one library, the
owner of them might safely demand 4000 guineas for such a
treasure.
</p>

<p class="center">5. <i>Philosophy, Mathematics, Inventions, Agriculture and<br />
Horticulture, Medicine, Cookery, Surgery, etc.</i></p>

<p>Two hundred and forty articles, or about 560 volumes.</p>

<p class="center">6. <i>Chemistry, Natural History, Astrology, Sorcery,
Gigantology.</i></p>

<p>Probably not more than 100 volumes.</p>

<p class="center">7. <i>History and Antiquities.</i></p>

<p>This comprehended a great number of curious and valuable
productions, relating both to foreign and domestic
transactions.
</p>

<p class="center">8. <i>Heraldry and Genealogy.</i></p>

<p>A great number of curious and scarce articles may be found
under these heads.</p>

<p class="center">9. <i>Ancient Legends and Chronicles.</i></p>

<p>To the English antiquary, few departments of literature are
more interesting that these. Mr. West seems to have paid
particular attention to them, and to have enriched his
library with many articles of this description, of the
rarest occurrence. The lovers of Caxton, Fabian, Hardyng,
Hall, Grafton, and Holinshed, may be highly gratified by
inspecting the various editions of these old chroniclers. I
entreat the diligent bibliographer to examine the first
eight articles of page 209 of the catalogue. Alas, when will
all these again come under the hammer at one sale?!</p>

<p class="center">10. <i>Topography.</i></p>

<p>Even to a veteran, like the late Mr. <span class="smcap">Gough</span>, such a
collection as may be found from p. 217 to p. 239 of this
catalogue, would be considered a first-rate acquisition. I
am aware that the gothic wainscot, and stained glass
windows, of <i>Enfield Study</i> enshrined a still more exquisite
topographical collection! But we are improved since the days
of Mr. West; and every body knows to <i>whom</i> these
improvements are, in a great measure, to be attributed. When
I call to mind the author of '<i>British Topography</i>' and
'<i>Sepulchral Monuments</i>,' I am not insensible to the taste,
diligence, and erudition of the "par nobile fratrum," who
have gratified us with the '<i>Environs of London</i>,' '<i>Roman
Remains</i>,' and the first two volumes of '<i>Magna Britannia</i>!'
</p><p>
The preceding is to be considered as a very general, and
therefore superficial, analysis of the catalogue of Mr.
West's library; copies of it, with the sums for which the
books were sold, are now found with difficulty, and bring a
considerable price. I never saw or heard of one on <span class="smcap">large
paper</span>!</p>

<p>I will, however, only add that there were upwards of 150
articles of <i>Old Plays</i>, mostly in quarto. See page 73. Of
<i>Antiquities</i>, <i>Chronicles</i>, and <i>Topography</i>, it would be
difficult to pitch upon the rarest volumes. The collection,
including very few MSS., contained 3641 articles, or
probably nearly 7000 volumes. The Catalogue is uncommon.</p>

known in the bibliographical world that the reader need not
be detained with laboured commendations on either: in the
present place, however, it would be a cruel disappointment
not to say a word or two by way of <i>preface</i> or <i>prologue</i>.
</p><p>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Anthony Askew</span> had eminently distinguished himself by a
refined taste, a sound knowledge, and an indefatigable
research relating to every thing connected with Grecian and
Roman literature. It was to be expected, even during his
life, as he was possessed of sufficient means to gratify
himself with what was rare, curious, and beautiful in
literature and the fine arts, that the public would, one
day, be benefited by such pursuits: especially as he had
expressed a wish that his treasures might be unreservedly
submitted to sale, after his decease. In this wish the
Doctor was not singular. Many eminent collectors had
indulged it before him: and, to my knowledge, many modern
ones still indulge it. Accordingly on the death of Dr.
Askew, in 1774, appeared, in the ensuing year, a catalogue
of his books for sale, by Messrs. Baker and Leigh, under the
following title:
</p><p>
"<span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Askeviana</span>, sive Catalogus Librorum Rarissimorum
<span class="smcap">Antonii Askew</span>, M.D., quorum Auctio fiet apud S. Baker et G.
Leigh, in Vico dicto <i>York Street, Covent Garden</i>, Londini.
<i>Die Lunæ</i>, 13 <i>Februarii</i>, MDCCLXXV, et in undeviginti
sequentes dies." A few copies were struck off on large
paper.
</p><p>
We are told by the compiler of the catalogue that it was
thought unnecessary to say much with respect to this Library
of the late Dr. Anthony Askew, as the Collector and
Collection were so well known in almost all parts of Europe.
Afterwards it is observed that "The books in general are in
very fine condition, many of them bound in morocco, and
Russia leather, with gilt leaves." "To give a particular
account," continues the Compiler, "of the <i>many scarce
editions</i> of books in this Catalogue would be almost
endless, therefore the <i>first editions</i> of the Classics, and
some <i>extremely rare books</i> are chiefly noticed. The
catalogue, without any doubt, contains the best, rarest, and
most valuable collection of <span class="smcap">Greek</span> and <span class="smcap">Latin Books</span> that were
ever sold in England." This account is not overcharged. The
collection, in regard to Greek and Roman literature, was
<i>unique</i> in its day.
</p><p>
The late worthy and learned Mr. M. <span class="smcap">Cracherode</span>, whose library
now forms one of the most splendid acquisitions of the
British Museum, and whose <i>bequest</i> of it will immortalize
his memory, was also among the "Emptores literarii" at this
renowned sale. He had enriched his collection with many
<i>Exemplar Askevianum</i>; and, in his latter days, used to
elevate his hands and eyes, and exclaim against the prices
<i>now</i> offered for <span class="smcap">Editiones Principes</span>!
</p><p>
The fact is, Dr. Askew's sale has been considered a sort of
<i>æra</i> in bibliography. Since that period, rare and curious
books in Greek and Latin literature have been greedily
sought after, and obtained at most extravagant prices. It is
very well for a veteran in bibliography, as was Mr.
Cracherode, or as are Mr. Wodhull and Dr. Gosset, whose
collections were formed in the days of Gaignat, Askew, Duke
de la Valliere, and Lamoignon&mdash;it is very well for such
gentlemen to declaim against <i>modern prices</i>! But what is to
be done? Books grow scarcer every day, and the love of
literature, and of possessing rare and interesting works,
increases in an equal ratio. Hungry bibliographers meet, at
sales, with well furnished purses, and are resolved upon
sumptuous fare. Thus the hammer <i>vibrates</i>, after a bidding
of <i>Forty pounds</i>, where formerly it used regularly to
<i>fall</i> at <i>Four</i>!
</p><p>
But we lose sight of Dr. Askew's <i>rare editions</i>, and <i>large
paper copies</i>. The following, gentle Reader, is but an
imperfect specimen!

<p class="tbp">After this melancholy event, one would have thought that future
<i>Virtuosi</i> would have barricadoed their doors, and fumigated their
chambers, to keep out such a pest;&mdash;but how few are they who profit by
experience, even when dearly obtained! The subsequent history of the
disease is a striking proof of the truth of this remark; for the
madness of book-collecting rather increased&mdash;and the work of death
still went on. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_41" id="Page_B_41">B. 41</a></span> the year 1776 died John Ratcliffe<a name="FNanchor_47_49" id="FNanchor_47_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_49" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> another, and
a very singular, instance of the fatality of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>. If he
had contented himself with his former occupation, and frequented the
butter and cheese, instead of the book, market&mdash;if he could have
<i>fancied himself</i> in a brown peruke, and Russian apron, instead of an
embroidered waistcoat, velvet breeches, and flowing perriwig, he
might, perhaps, have enjoyed greater longevity; but, infatuated by the
Caxtons and Wynkyn De Wordes of Fletewode and of West, he fell into
the snare; and the more he struggled to disentangle himself, the more
certainly did he become a prey to the disease.</p>

If I might hazard a comparison between Mr. James West's and
Mr. John Ratcliffe's collections, I should say that the
former was more extensive, the latter more curious: Mr.
West's, like a magnificent <i>champagne</i>, executed by the hand
of Claude or Both, and enclosing mountains, and meadows, and
streams, presented to the eye of the beholder a scene at
once extensive, luxuriant, and fruitful: Mr. Ratcliffe's,
like one of those delicious pieces of scenery, touched by
the pencil of Rysdael or Hobbima, exhibited to the
beholder's eye a spot equally interesting, but less varied
and extensive. The sweeping foliage and rich pasture of the
former could not, perhaps, afford greater gratification than
did the thatched cottage, abrupt declivities, and gushing
streams of the latter. To change the metaphor&mdash;Mr. West's
was a magnificent repository, Mr. Ratcliffe's a choice
cabinet of gems.</p>

<p class="tp">Thirty years have been considered by Addison (some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_42" id="Page_B_42">B. 42</a></span>where in his
Spectator) as a pretty accurate period for the passing away of one
generation and the coming on of another. We have brought down our
researches to within a similar period of the present times; but, as
Addison has not made out the proofs of such assertion, and as many of
the relatives and friends of those who have fallen victims to the
<span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>, since the days of Ratcliffe, may yet be alive; moreover,
as it is the part of humanity not to tear open wounds which have been
just closed, or awaken painful sensibilities which have been well nigh
laid to rest; so, my dear Sir, in giving you a further account of this
fatal disorder, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_43" id="Page_B_43">B. 43</a></span> deem it the most prudent method <i>not to expatiate</i>

may not be increased by those of living characters!</p>

<p>We are, in the <span class="smcap">second</span> place, to describe the <span class="smcap">Symptoms of the Disease</span>.</p>

<p class="bp">The ingenious Peignot, in the first volume of his 'Dictionnaire
Bibliologie,' p. 51, defines the Bibliomania<a name="FNanchor_48_50" id="FNanchor_48_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_50" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> to be "a passion for
possessing books; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_44" id="Page_B_44">B. 44</a></span> so much to be instructed by them, as to gratify
the eye by looking on them. He who is affected by this mania knows
books only by their titles and dates, and is rather seduced by the
exterior than interior"! This is, perhaps, too general and vague a
definition to be of much benefit in the knowledge, and consequent
prevention, of the disease: let us, therefore, describe it more
certainly and intelligibly.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_48_50" id="Footnote_48_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_50">[48]</a> There is a short, but smart and interesting,
article on this head in Mr. D'Israeli's <i>Curiosities of
Literature</i>, vol. 1. 10. "Bruyere has touched on this mania
with humour; of such a collector (one who is fond of superb
bindings only) says he, as soon as I enter his house, I am
ready to faint on the stair-case from a strong smell of
morocco leather. In vain he shows me fine editions, gold
leaves, Etruscan bindings, &amp;c.&mdash;naming them one after
another, as if he were showing a gallery of pictures!"
Lucian has composed a biting invective against an ignorant
possessor of a vast library. "One who opens his eyes, with
an hideous stare, at an old book, and, after turning over
the pages, chiefly admires the <i>date</i> of its publication."</p>

<p class="bp">I. <i>Large Paper Copies.</i> These are a certain set or limited number of
the work printed in a superior manner, both in regard to ink and press
work, on paper of a larger size, and better quality, than the ordinary
copies. Their price is enhanced in proportion to their beauty and
rarity. In the note below<a name="FNanchor_49_51" id="FNanchor_49_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_51" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> are specified a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_45" id="Page_B_45">B. 45</a></span> works which have
been published in this manner, that the sober collector may avoid

5. <i>Sandford's Genealogical History</i>, etc. 1707, fol. Mr.
Arch of Cornhill purchased a copy of this work on large
paper, at the late sale of Baron Smyth's books, for £46. If
the largest paper of Clarke's Cæsar be excepted, this is the
highest priced single volume on large paper, that I just now
recollect.
</p><p>
6. <i>Hearne's Works</i> on large paper.
</p><p>
Something relating to Hearne will be found in the note at
<a href="#Page_B_7">page 7</a> ante. Here it will be only necessary to observe that
the Hernëan rage for Large Paper is quite of recent growth,
but it promises to be giant-like. When the duplicates of a
part of Mr. Woodhull's library, in 1803, were sold, there
was a fine set of copies of this kind; but the prices,
comparatively with those now offered, were extremely
moderate. Mr. Otridge, the bookseller, told me an amusing
story of his going down to Liverpool, many years ago, and
accidentally purchasing from the library of the late Sir
Thomas Hanmer, a <i>magnificent set of Large Paper Hearnes</i>
for about 40 Guineas. Many of these are now in the choice
library of his Grace the Duke of Grafton. The copies were
catalogued as <i>small</i> paper. Was there ever a more provoking
blunder?!</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">This<a name="FNanchor_50_52" id="FNanchor_50_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_52" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> symptom of the Bibliomania is, at the present day, both
general and violent, and threatens to extend still more widely. Even
modern publications are not exempt from its calamitous influence; and
when Mr. Miller, the bookseller, told me with what eagerness the large
paper copies of Lord Valentia's Travels were bespoke, and Mr. Evans
shewed me that every similar copy of his new edition of "Burnett's
History of his own Times" was disposed of, I could not help elevating
my eyes and hands, in token of commis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_46" id="Page_B_46">B. 46</a></span>eration at the prevalence of
this Symptom of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_50_52" id="Footnote_50_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_52">[50]</a> Analogous to Large Paper Copies are <i>tall
Copies</i>; that is, copies of the work published on the
ordinary size paper and not much cut down by the binder. The
want of <i>margin</i> is a serious grievance complained of by
book-collectors; and when there is a contest of
margin-measuring, with books never professedly published on
large paper, the anxiety of each party to have the largest
copy is better conceived than described! How carefully, and
how adroitly, are the golden and silver rules then
exercised!</p>

<p class="tbp">II. <i>Uncut Copies.</i> Of all the symptoms of the Bibliomania, this is
probably the most extraordinary. It may be defined as a passion to
possess books of which the edges have never been sheared by the
binder's tools. And here, my dear Sir, I find myself walking upon
doubtful ground;&mdash;your <span class="smcap">uncut Hearnes</span> rise up in "rough majesty" before
me, and almost "push me from my stool." Indeed, when I look around in
my book-lined tub, I cannot but be conscious that this symptom of the
disorder has reached my own threshold; but when it is known that a few
of my bibliographical books are left with the edges uncut <i>merely to
please my friends</i> (as one must sometimes study their tastes and
appetites as well as one's own), I trust that no very serious
conclusions will be drawn about the probable fatality of my own case.
As to uncut copies, although their inconvenience [an uncut lexicon to
wit!] and deformity must be acknowledged, and although a rational man
can want for nothing better than a book <i>once well bound</i>, yet we find
that the extraordinary passion for collecting them not only obtains
with full force, but is attended with very serious consequences to
those "qui n'ont point des pistoles" (to borrow the language of
Clement; vol. vi. p. 36). I dare say an uncut <i>first Shakspeare</i>, as
well as an uncut <i>first Homer</i><a name="FNanchor_51_53" id="FNanchor_51_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_53" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> would produce a little annuity!</p>

<p class="tbp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_47" id="Page_B_47">B. 47</a></span>III. <i>Illustrated Copies.</i> A passion for books illustrated or adorned
with numerous prints, representing characters or circumstances
mentioned in the work, is a very general and violent symptom of the
Bibliomania, which has been known chiefly within the last half
century. The origin, or first appearance, of this symptom has been
traced by some to the publication of Granger's "Biographical History
of England;" but whoever will be at the pains of reading the preface
of this work will see that Granger sheltered himself under the
authorities of Evelyn, Ashmole, and others; and that he alone is not
to be considered as responsible for all the mischief which this
passion for collecting prints has occasioned. Granger, however, was
the first who introduced it in the form of a treatise, and surely "in
an evil hour" was this treatise published&mdash;although its amiable author
must be acquitted of "malice prepense." His History of England<a name="FNanchor_52_54" id="FNanchor_52_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_54" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
seems to have sounded the tocsin for a general rummage after, and
slaughter of, old prints: venerable philosophers and veteran heroes,
who had long reposed in unmolested dignity within the magnificent
folio volumes which recorded their achievements, were instantly
dragged from their peaceful abodes to be inlaid by the side of some
spruce, modern engraving, within an <span class="smcap">Illustrated Granger</span>! Nor did the
madness stop here. Illustration was the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_48" id="Page_B_48">B. 48</a></span> the day; and
Shakspeare<a name="FNanchor_53_55" id="FNanchor_53_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_55" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and Clarendon<a name="FNanchor_54_56" id="FNanchor_54_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_56" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> became the next objects of its
attack. From these it has glanced off in a variety of directions, to
adorn the pages of humbler wights; and the passion, or rather this
symptom of the Bibliomania,<a name="FNanchor_55_57" id="FNanchor_55_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_57" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> yet rages with undiminished force. If
judiciously<a name="FNanchor_56_58" id="FNanchor_56_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_58" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> treated, it is, of all the symptoms, the least liable
to mischief. To possess a series of well executed portraits of
illustrious men, at different periods of their lives, from blooming
boyhood to phlegmatic old age, is sufficiently amusing<a name="FNanchor_57_59" id="FNanchor_57_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_59" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>; but to
possess <i>every</i> portrait, <i>bad, indifferent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_49" id="Page_B_49">B. 49</a></span> unlike</i>, betrays
such a dangerous and alarming symptom as to render the case almost
incurable!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_52_54" id="Footnote_52_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_54">[52]</a> It was first published in two quarto volumes,
1766; and went through several editions in octavo. The last
is, I believe, of the date of 1804; to which three
additional volumes were published by William Noble, in 1806;
the whole seven volumes form what is called an excellent
library work.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_53_55" id="Footnote_53_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_55">[53]</a> About two or three years ago there was an
extraordinary set of prints disposed of, for the
illustration of Shakspeare, collected by a gentleman in
Cornwall, with considerable taste and judgment. Lord
Spencer's beautiful octavo illustrated Shakespeare,
bequeathed to him by the late Mr. Steevens, has been
enriched, since it came into the library of its present
noble possessor, with many a rare and many a beauteous
specimen of the graphic art.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_54_56" id="Footnote_54_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_56">[54]</a> I have heard of an illustrated Clarendon
(which was recently in the metropolis), that has been valued
at 5000 Guineas! "a good round sum!"</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_55_57" id="Footnote_55_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_57">[55]</a> One of the most striking and splendid
instances of the present rage for illustration may be seen
in Mr. Miller's own copy of the Historical Work of Mr. Fox,
in two volumes, imperial quarto. Exclusively of a great
variety of Portraits, it is enriched with the original
drawing of Mr. Fox's bust from which the print, attached to
the publication, is taken; and has also many original notes
and letters by its illustrious author. Mr. Walter Scott's
edition of Dryden has also received, by the same publisher,
a similar illustration. It is on large paper, and most
splendidly bound in blue morocco, containing upwards of 650
portraits.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_56_58" id="Footnote_56_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_58">[56]</a> The fine copy of Granger, illustrated by the
late Mr. Bull, is now in the library of the Marquis of Bute,
at Lutton. It extends to 37 atlas folio volumes, and is a
repository of almost every rare and beautiful print, which
the diligence of its late, and the skill, taste, and
connoisseurship of its present, noble owner have brought
together.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_57_59" id="Footnote_57_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_59">[57]</a> In the Memoirs of Mr. Thomas Hollis there is a
series of the portraits of Milton (not executed in the best
manner) done in this way; and a like series of Pope's
portraits accompanies the recent edition of the poet's works
by the Rev. W.L. Bowles.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">There is another mode of illustrating copies by which this symptom of
the Bibliomania may be known: it consists in bringing together, from
different works, [by means of the scissors, or otherwise by
transcription] every page or paragraph which has any connection with
the character or subject under discussion. This is a useful and
entertaining mode of illustrating a favourite author; and copies of
works of this nature, when executed by skilful<a name="FNanchor_58_60" id="FNanchor_58_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_60" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> hands, should be
preserved in public repositories. I almost ridiculed the idea of an
<span class="smcap">Illustrated Chatterton</span>, in this way, till I saw Mr. Haslewood's copy,
in twenty-one volumes, which rivetted me to my seat!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_58_60" id="Footnote_58_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_60">[58]</a> Numerous are the instances of the peculiar use
and value of copies of this kind, especially to those who
are engaged in publication, of a similar nature. Oldys's
interleaved Langbaine is re-echoed in almost every recent
work connected with the belles-lettres of our country. Oldys
himself was unrivalled in this method of illustration; if,
besides his Langbaine, his copy of 'Fuller's Worthies' [once
Mrs. Steevens's, now Mr. Malone's, See Bibl. Steevens,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 1799] be alone considered! This Oldys was the oddest
mortal that ever scribbled for bread. Grose, in his <i>Olio</i>,
gives an amusing account of his having "a number of small
parchment bags inscribed with the names of the persons whose
lives he intended to write; into which he put every
circumstance and anecdote he could collect, and thence drew
up his history." See Noble's <i>College of Arms</i>, p. 420.
</p><p>
Of illustrated copies in this way, the Suidas of Kuster,
belonging to the famous D'Orville, is a memorable instance.
This is now in the Bodleian library. I should suppose that
one Narcissus Luttrell, in Charles the Second's reign, had a
number of like illustrated copies. His collection of
contemporaneous literature must have been immense, as we may
conclude from the account of it in Mr. Walter Scott's
Preface to his recent edition of Dryden's works. Luckily for
this brilliant poet and editor, a part of Luttrell's
collection had found its way into the libraries of Mr.
Bindley and Mr. Heber, and thence was doomed to shine, with
renewed lustre, by the side of the poetry of Dryden.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">IV. <i>Unique Copies.</i> A passion for a book which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_50" id="Page_B_50">B. 50</a></span> has any peculiarity
about it, by either, or both, of the foregoing methods of
illustration&mdash;or which is remarkable for its size, beauty, and
condition&mdash;is indicative of a rage for <i>unique copies</i>, and is
unquestionably a strong prevailing symptom of the Bibliomania. Let me
therefore urge every sober and cautious collector not to be fascinated
by the terms "<i>Matchless, and Unique</i>;" which, "in slim Italicks" (to
copy Dr. Ferriar's happy expression) are studiously introduced into
Bookseller's catalogues to lead the unwary astray. Such a Collector
may fancy himself proof against the temptation; and will, in
consequence, <i>call only to look at</i> this unique book, or set of books;
but, when he views the morocco binding, silk water-tabby lining,
blazing gilt edges&mdash;when he turns over the white and spotless
leaves&mdash;gazes on the amplitude of margin&mdash;on a rare and lovely print
introduced&mdash;and is charmed with the soft and coaxing manner in which,
by the skill of Herring or Mackinlay,<a name="FNanchor_59_61" id="FNanchor_59_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_61" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> "leaf succeeds to leaf"&mdash;he
can no longer bear up against the temptation&mdash;and, confessing himself
vanquished, purchases, and retreats&mdash;exclaiming with Virgil's
shepherd&mdash;</p>

<p class="centerbp">Ut vidi, ut perii&mdash;ut me malus abstulit error!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_59_61" id="Footnote_59_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_61">[59]</a> At <a href="#Page_8">page 8</a>, note&mdash;the reader has been led to
expect a few remarks upon the luxuriancy of modern
book-binding. Mr. Roscoe, in his Lorenzo de Medici, vol.
ii., p. 79., edit. 8vo., has defended the art with so much
skill that nothing further need be said in commendation of
it. Admitting every degree of merit to our present
fashionable binders, and frankly allowing them the
superiority over De Rome, Padaloup, and the old school of
binding, I cannot but wish to see revived those beautiful
portraits, arabesque borders, and sharp angular ornaments,
that are often found on the outsides of books bound in the
16th century, with calf leather, upon oaken boards. These
brilliant decorations almost make us forget the ivory
crucifix, guarded with silver doors, which is frequently
introduced in the interior of the sides of the binding. Few
things are more gratifying to a genuine collector than a
fine copy of a book in its <i>original binding</i>!</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_51" id="Page_B_51">B. 51</a></span>V. <i>Copies printed on vellum.</i> A desire for works printed in this
manner is an equally strong and general symptom of the Bibliomania;
but as these works are rarely to be obtained of modern<a name="FNanchor_60_62" id="FNanchor_60_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_62" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> date, the
collector is obliged to have recourse to specimens, executed three
centuries ago, in the printing-offices of Aldus, Verard, and the
Juntæ. Although the Bibliothéque Imperiale, at Paris, and the library
of Count Macarty, at Toulouse, are said to contain the greatest number
of books printed upon vellum, yet, those who have been fortunate
enough to see copies of this kind in the libraries of his Majesty, the
Duke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Mr. Johnes, and the late Mr.
Cracherode (now in the British Museum), need not travel on the
Continent for the sake of being convinced of their exquisite beauty
and splendour. Mr. Edward's <i>unique</i> copy (he will forgive the
epithet) of the first Livy, upon vellum, is a Library of itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_52" id="Page_B_52">B. 52</a></span>!&mdash;and
the recent discovery of a vellum copy of Wynkyn De Worde's reprint of
<i>Juliana Barnes's book</i>,<a name="FNanchor_61_63" id="FNanchor_61_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_63" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> complete in every respect, [to say
nothing of his Majesty's similar copy of Caxton's <i>Doctrinal of
Sapience</i>, 1489, in the finest preservation] are, to be sure,
sufficient demonstrations of the prevalence of this symptom of the
Bibliomania in the times of our forefathers; so that it cannot be
said, as some have asserted, to have appeared entirely within the last
half century.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_60_62" id="Footnote_60_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_62">[60]</a> The modern books, printed upon vellum, have in
general not succeeded; whether from the art of preparing the
vellum, or of printing upon it, being lost I will not
presume to determine. The reader may be amused with the
following prices for which a few works, executed in this
manner, were sold in the year 1804:</p>

<p class="tbp">VI. <i>First Editions.</i> From the time of Ancillon<a name="FNanchor_62_64" id="FNanchor_62_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_64" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> to Askew, there
has been a very strong desire expressed for the possession of original
or first published editions of works, as they are in general
superintended and corrected by the author himself; and, like the first
impressions of prints, are considered more valuable. Whoever is
possessed with a passion for collecting books of this kind may
unquestionably be said to exhibit a strong symptom of the Bibliomania;
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_53" id="Page_B_53">B. 53</a></span> such a case is not quite hopeless, nor is it deserving of severe
treatment or censure. All bibliographers have dwelt on the importance
of these editions, for the sake of collation with subsequent ones, and
detecting, as is frequently the case, the carelessness displayed by
future<a name="FNanchor_63_65" id="FNanchor_63_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_65" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> editors. Of such importance is the <i>first edition of
Shakspeare</i><a name="FNanchor_64_66" id="FNanchor_64_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_66" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> considered, that a fac-simile reprint of it has been
published with success. In regard to the Greek and Latin Classics, the
possession of these original editions is of the first consequence to
editors who are anxious to republish the legitimate text of an author.
Wakefield, I believe always regretted that the first edition of
Lucretius had not been earlier inspected by him. When he began <i>his</i>
edition, the Editio Princeps was not (as I have understood) in the
library of Earl Spencer&mdash;the storehouse of almost every thing that is
exquisite and rare in ancient classical literature!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_62_64" id="Footnote_62_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_64">[62]</a> There is a curious and amusing article in
Bayle [English edition, vol. i., 672, &amp;c.] about the elder
<span class="smcap">Ancillon</span>, who frankly confessed that he "was troubled with
the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>, or disease of buying books." Mr. D'Israeli
says "that he always purchased <i>first editions</i>, and never
waited for second ones,"&mdash;but I find it, in the English
Bayle, note D, "he chose <i>the best</i> editions." The manner in
which Ancillon's library was pillaged by the Ecclesiastics
of Metz (where it was considered as the most valuable
curiosity in the town) is thus told by Bayle; "Ancillon was
obliged to leave Metz: a company of Ecclesiastics, of all
orders, came from every part, to lay hands on this fine and
copious library, which had been collected with the utmost
care during forty years. They took away a great number of
the books together, and gave a little money, as they went
out, to a young girl, of twelve or thirteen years of age,
who looked after them, that they might have it to say they
had <i>paid for them</i>. Thus Ancillon saw that valuable
collection dispersed, in which, as he was wont to say, his
chief pleasure and even his heart was placed!"&mdash;Edit. 1734.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_63_65" id="Footnote_63_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_65">[63]</a> An instance of this kind may be adduced from
the <i>first edition</i> of Fabian, printed in 1516; of which
Messrs. Longman, and Co., have now engaged a very able
editor to collate the text with that of the subsequent
editions. "The antiquary," says the late Mr. <span class="smcap">Brand</span>, "is
desired to consult the edition of Fabian, printed by Pynson,
in 1516, because there are others, and I remember to have
seen one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a
continuation to the end of Queen Mary, 1559, in which the
<i>language is much modernised</i>." Shakespeare, edit. 1803,
vol. xviii. p. 85-6.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_64_66" id="Footnote_64_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_66">[64]</a> A singular story is "extant" about the
purchase of the late Duke of Roxburgh's fine copy of the
first edition of Shakespeare. A friend was bidding for him
in the sale-room: his Grace had retired to a distance, to
view the issue of the contest. Twenty guineas and more were
offered, from various quarters, for the book: a slip of
paper was handed to the Duke, in which he was requested to
inform his friend whether he was "to go on bidding"&mdash;His
Grace took his pencil, and wrote underneath, by way of reply&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
&mdash;&mdash;lay on Macduff!<br />
And d&mdash;&mdash;d be he who first cries, 'Hold, enough!'<br />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Such a spirit was irresistible, and bore down all
opposition. His Grace retired triumphant, with the book
under his arm.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_54" id="Page_B_54">B. 54</a></span>It must not, however, be forgotten that if first editions are, in some
instances, of great importance, they are in many respects superfluous,
and an incumbrance to the shelves of a collector; inasmuch as the
labours of subsequent editors have corrected their errors, and
superseded, by a great fund of additional matter, the necessity of
consulting them. Thus, not to mention other instances (which present
themselves while noticing the present one), all the fine things which
Colomiés and Remannus have said about the rarity of La Croix du
Maine's Bibliotheque, published in 1584, are now unnecessary to be
attended to, since the ample and excellent edition of this work by De
La Monnoye and Juvigny, in six quarto volumes, 1772, has appeared. Nor
will any one be tempted to hunt for Gesner's Bibliotheca of 1545-8,
whatever may be its rarity, who has attended to Morhof's and Vogt's
recommendation of the last and best edition of 1583.</p>

<p class="bp">VII. <i>True Editions.</i> Some copies of a work are struck off with
deviations from the usually received ones, and, though these
deviations have neither sense nor beauty to recommend them, [and
indeed are principally <i>defects</i>] yet copies of this description are
eagerly sought after by collectors of a certain class! This particular
pursuit may therefore be called another, or the seventh, symptom of
the Bibliomania. The note below <a name="FNanchor_65_67" id="FNanchor_65_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_67" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> will furnish the reader with a

<p class="tbp">A perusal of these articles may probably not impress the reader with
any lofty notions of the superiority of the black letter; but this
symptom of the Bibliomania is, nevertheless, not to be considered as
incurable, or wholly unproductive of good. Under a proper spirit of
modification it has done, and will continue to do, essential service
to the cause of English literature. It guided the taste, and
strengthened the judgment, of Tyrwhitt in his researches after
Chaucerian lore. It stimulated the studies of Farmer and of Steevens,
and enabled them to twine many a beauteous flower round the brow of
their beloved Shakespeare. It has since operated, to the same effect,
in the labours of Mr. Douce,<a name="FNanchor_68_70" id="FNanchor_68_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_70" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the <i>Porson</i> of old English and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_57" id="Page_B_57">B. 57</a></span>
French literature; and in the editions of Milton and Spenser, by my
amiable and excellent friend Mr. Todd the public have had a specimen
of what the <i>Black Letter</i> may perform, when temperately and skilfully
exercised.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_68_70" id="Footnote_68_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_70">[68]</a> In the criticisms on Mr. Douce's
<i>Illustrations of Shakspeare and Ancient Manners</i>, it has
not, I think, been generally noticed that this work is
distinguished; 1. For the singular diffidence and urbanity
of criticism, as well as depth of learning, which it
evinces: 2. For the happy illustrations, by means of wood
cuts: Let any one, for instance, read a laboured
disquisition on the punishment of "the boots"&mdash;and only
glance his eye on the plate representing it [vol. i. p.
34.]: from which will he obtain the clearer notions? 3. For
the taste, elegance, and general correctness with which it
is printed. The only omission I regret is that Mr. Douce did
not give us, at the end, a list of the works alphabetically
arranged, with their dates which he consulted in the
formation of his own. Such a <span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Shakspeariana</span>
might, however, have been only a fresh stimulus to the
increase of the black-letter symptom of the <i>Bibliomania</i>.
How Bartholomæus and Batman have risen in price since the
publication of Mr. Douce's work, let those who have lately
smarted for the increase tell!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">I could bring to your recollection other instances; but your own
copious reading and exact memory will better furnish you with them.
Let me not however omit remarking that the beautiful pages of the
<i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and Sir Trestrem</i>, exhibit, in the
notes [now and then thickly studded with black letter references], a
proof that the author of "The Lay" and "Marmion" has not disdained to
enrich his stores of information by such intelligence as black
lettered books impart. In short, though this be also a strong and
general symptom of the Bibliomania, it is certainly not attended with
injurious effects when regulated by prudence and discretion. An
undistinguishable voracious appetite, to swallow every thing printed
in the black letter can only bring on inconquerable disease, if not
death, to the patient!</p>

<p>Having in the two preceding divisions of this letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_58" id="Page_B_58">B. 58</a></span> discoursed
somewhat largely upon the <span class="smcap">History</span> and <span class="smcap">Symptoms</span> of the Bibliomania, it
now remains, according to the original plan, to say a few words upon
the <span class="smcap">Probable Means of its Cure</span>. And, indeed, I am driven to this view
of the subject from every laudable motive; for it would be highly
censurable to leave any reflecting mind impressed with melancholy
emotions concerning the misery and mortality that have been occasioned
by the abuse of those pursuits, to which the most soothing and
important considerations ought to be attached. Far from me, and my
friends, be such a cruel, if not criminal, conduct; let us then, my
dear Sir, seriously discourse upon the</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Probable Means of the cure</span> of the Bibliomania. <i>He</i> will surely
be numbered among the philanthropists of his day who has, more
successfully than myself, traced and described the ravages of this
disease, and fortified the sufferer with the means of its cure. But,
as this is a disorder of quite a recent date, and as its
characteristics, in consequence, cannot be yet fully known or
described, great candour must be allowed to that physician who offers
a prescription for so obscure and complicated a case. It is in vain
that you search the works [ay, even the best editions] of Hippocrates
and Galen for a description of this malady; nor will you find it
hinted at in the more philosophical treatises of Sydenham and
Heberden. It had, till the medical skill of Dr. Ferriar first noticed
it to the public, escaped the observations of all our pathologists.
With a trembling hand, and fearful apprehension, therefore, I throw
out the following suggestions for the cure, or <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: mitigation">mitigatiou</span>, of this disorder:</p>

<p>In <i>the first place</i>, the disease of the Bibliomania is materially
softened, or rendered mild, by directing our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_59" id="Page_B_59">B. 59</a></span> studies to <i>useful and
profitable</i> works&mdash;whether these be printed upon small or large paper,
in the gothic, roman, or italic type; To consider purely the
<i>intrinsic</i> excellence, and not the exterior splendour, or
adventitious value, of any production, will keep us perhaps wholly
free from this disease. Let the midnight lamp be burnt to illuminate
the stores of antiquity&mdash;whether they be romances, or chronicles, or
legends, and whether they be printed by Aldus or by Caxton&mdash;if a
brighter lustre can thence be thrown upon the pages of modern
learning! To trace genius to its source, or to see how she has been
influenced or modified, by "the lore of past times" is both a pleasing
and profitable pursuit. To see how Shakspeare has here and there
plucked a flower, from some old ballad or popular tale, to enrich his
own unperishable garland&mdash;to follow Spenser and Milton in their
delightful labyrinths 'midst the splendour of Italian literature&mdash;are
studies which stamp a dignity upon our intellectual characters! But,
in such a pursuit let us not overlook the wisdom of modern times, nor
fancy that what is only ancient can be excellent. We must remember
that Bacon, Boyle, Locke, Taylor, Chillingworth, Robertson, Hume,
Gibbon, and Paley, are names which always command attention from the
wise, and remind us of the improved state of reason and acquired
knowledge during the two last centuries.</p>

<p class="bp">In the <i>second place</i>, the re-printing of scarce and intrinsically
valuable works is another means of preventing the propagation of this
disorder. Amidst all our present sufferings under the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>, it
is some consolation to find discerning and spirited booksellers
re-publishing the valuable Chronicles of Froissart, Holinshed, and
Hall,<a name="FNanchor_69_71" id="FNanchor_69_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_71" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and the collections known by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_60" id="Page_B_60">B. 60</a></span> names of "The Harleïan
Miscellany," and "Lord Somer's Tracts." These are noble efforts, and
richly deserve the public patronage.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_69_71" id="Footnote_69_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_71">[69]</a> The re-publication of these chronicles is to
be followed by those of Grafton and Fabian. Meanwhile,
Hakluyt's Voyages, (projected by Mr. Evans), and Fuller's
Worthies (by Messrs. Longman, and Co.) will form admirable
acquisitions to these treasures of past times.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">In the <i>third place</i>, the editing of our best ancient authors, whether
in prose or poetry,<a name="FNanchor_70_72" id="FNanchor_70_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_72" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> is another means of effectually counteracting
the progress of the Bibliomania, as it has been described under its
several symptoms.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_70_72" id="Footnote_70_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_72">[70]</a> The recent <i>Variorum</i> editions of Shakspeare,
of which some yet prefer that of Steevens, 1793, 15 vols.
8vo.&mdash;Mr. Todd's editions of Milton and Spenser; Mr. G.
Chalmers' edition of Sir David Lyndsay's works; Mr.
Gifford's edition of Massinger; and Mr. Octavius
Gilchrist's, of Bishop Corbett's poems, exemplify the good
effects of this <i>third means of cure</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">In the <i>fourth place</i>, the erecting of Public Institutions<a name="FNanchor_71_73" id="FNanchor_71_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_73" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is a
very powerful antidote against the prevalence of several symptoms of
this disease.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_71_73" id="Footnote_71_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_73">[71]</a> The Royal, London, Surrey, and Russel
Institutions have been the means of concentrating, in divers
parts of the metropolis, large libraries of <i>useful</i> books;
which, it is to be hoped, will eventually suppress the
establishment of what are called <i>Circulating
Libraries</i>&mdash;vehicles, too often, of insufferable nonsense,
and irremediable mischief!</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">In the <i>fifth place</i>, the encouragement of the study of
Bibliography,<a name="FNanchor_72_74" id="FNanchor_72_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_74" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> in its legitimate sense, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_61" id="Page_B_61">B. 61</a></span> towards its true
object, may be numbered among the most efficacious cures for this
destructive malady. To place competent Librarians over the several
departments of a large public Library, or to submit a library, on a
more confined scale, to one diligent, enthusiastic, well informed,
well bred, Bibliographer<a name="FNanchor_73_75" id="FNanchor_73_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_75" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> or Librarian, [of which in this
metropolis we have so many examples] is doing a vast deal towards
directing the channels of literature to flow in their proper courses.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_72_74" id="Footnote_72_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_74">[72]</a> <span class="smcap">"Unne bonne Bibliographie</span>," says Marchand, "soit
générale soit particulière, soit profane, soit
écclésiastique, soit nationale, provinciale, ou locale, soit
simplement personnelle, en un mot de quelque autre genre que
ce puisse être, n'est pas un ouvrage aussi facile que
beaucoup de gens se le pourroient imaginer; mais, elles ne
doivent néanmoins <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: nullement">nulelment</span>
prévenir contre celle-ci. Telle qu'elle est, elle ne laisse
pas d'être bonne, utile, et digne d'être recherchée par les
amateurs, de l'Histoire Littéraire." <i>Diction. Historique</i>,
vol. i. p. 109.
</p><p>
"Our nation," says Mr. Bridgman, "has been too inattentive
to bibliographical criticisms and enquiries; for generally
the English reader is obliged to resort to foreign writers
to satisfy his mind as to the value of authors. It behoves
us to consider that there is not a more useful or a more
desirable branch of education than a <i>knowledge of books</i>;
which being correctly ascertained and judiciously exercised,
will prove the touch-stone of intrinsic merit, and have the
effect of saving many spotless pages from prostitution."
<i>Legal Bibliography</i>, p. v. vi.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_73_75" id="Footnote_73_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_75">[73]</a> Peignot, in his <i>Dictionnaire de Bibliologie</i>,
vol. i. 50, has given a very pompous account of what ought
to be the talents and duties of a Bibliographer. It would be
difficult indeed to find such things united in one person!
De Bure, in the eighth volume of his <i>Bibliographie
Instructive</i>, has prefixed a "Discourse upon the Science of
Bibliography and the duties of a Bibliographer" which is
worth consulting: but I know of nothing which better
describes, in few words, such a character, than the
following: "In eo sit multijuga materiarum librorumque
notitia, ut saltem potiores eligat et inquirat: fida et
sedula apud exteras gentes procuratio, ut eos arcessat;
summa patientia ut rarè venalis expectet: peculium semper
præsens et paratum, ne, si quando occurrunt, emendi occasio
intercidat; prudens denique auri argentique contemptus, ut
pecuniis sponte careat quæ in bibliothecam formandam et
nutriendam sunt insumendæ. Si fortè vir literatus eo
felicitatis pervenit ut talem thesaurum coaceraverit, nec
solus illo invidios fruatur, sed usum cum eruditis qui
vigilias suas utilitati publicæ devoverunt, liberaliter
communicet; &amp;c."&mdash;<i>Bibliotheca Hulsiana</i>, vol. i. Præfat. p.
3, 4.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">Thus briefly and guardedly have I thrown out a few suggestions, which
may enable us to avoid, or mitigate the severity of, the disease
called <span class="smcap">The Bibliomania</span>. Happy indeed shall I deem myself, if, in the
description of its symptoms, and in the recommendation of the means of
cure, I may have snatched any one from a premature grave, or lightened
the load of years that are yet to <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: come">cone</span>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_62" id="Page_B_62">B. 62</a></span></p>

<p>You, my dear Sir, who, in your observations upon society, as well as
in your knowledge of ancient times, must have met with numerous
instances of the miseries which "flesh is heir to," may be disposed
perhaps to confess that, of all species of afflictions, <i>the present
one</i> under consideration has the least moral turpitude attached to it.
True, it may be so: for, in the examples which have been adduced,
there will be found neither Suicides, nor Gamesters, nor Profligates.
No woman's heart has been broken from midnight debaucheries: no
marriage vow has been violated: no child has been compelled to pine in
poverty or neglect: no patrimony has been wasted, and no ancestor's
fame tarnished! If men have erred under the influence of this disease,
their aberrations have been marked with an excess arising from
intellectual fevour, and not from a desire of baser gratifications.</p>

<p>If, therefore, in the wide survey which a philosopher may take of the
"Miseries of Human life"<a name="FNanchor_74_76" id="FNanchor_74_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_76" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the prevalence of this disorder may
appear to be less mischievous than that of others, and, if some of the
most amiable and learned of mortals seemed to have been both
unwilling, as well as unable, to avoid its contagion, you will
probably feel the less alarmed if symptoms of it should appear within
the sequestered abode of Hodnet!<a name="FNanchor_75_77" id="FNanchor_75_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_77" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Recollecting that even in remoter
situations its influence has been felt&mdash;and that neither the pure
atmosphere of Hafod nor of Sledmere<a name="FNanchor_76_78" id="FNanchor_76_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_78" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> has com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_B_63" id="Page_B_63">B. 63</a></span>pletely subdued its
power&mdash;you will be disposed to exclaim with violence, at the intrusion
of Bibliomaniacs&mdash;</p>

<p class="tp">Upon the whole, therefore, attending closely to the symptoms of this
disorder as they have been described, and practising such means of
cure as have been recommended, we may rationally hope that its
virulence may abate, and the number of its victims annually diminish.

was on a fine autumnal evening, when the sun was setting serenely
behind a thick copse upon a distant hill, and his warm tints were
lighting up a magnificent and widely-extended landscape, that,
sauntering 'midst the fields, I was meditating upon the various
methods of honourably filling up the measure of our existence; when I
discovered, towards my left, a messenger running at full speed towards
me. The abruptness of his appearance, and the velocity of his step,
somewhat disconcerted me; but on his near approach my apprehensions
were dissipated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>I knew him to be the servant of my old college friend, whom I chuse
here to denominate <span class="smcap">Lysander</span>. He came to inform me, in his blunt and
honest manner, that his master had just arrived with <span class="smcap">Philemon</span>, our
common friend; and that, as they were too fatigued with their journey
to come out to me, they begged I would quickly enter the house, and,
as usual, make them welcome. This intelligence afforded me the
liveliest satisfaction. In fifteen minutes, after a hearty shaking of
hands, I was seated with them in the parlour; all of us admiring the
unusual splendour of the evening sky, and, in consequence, partaking
of the common topics of conversation with a greater flow of spirits.</p>

<p>"You are come, my friends," said I (in the course of conversation),
"to make some stay with me&mdash;indeed, I cannot suffer you to depart
without keeping you at least a week; in order, amongst other things,
to view the beauty of our neighbour Lorenzo's grounds, the general
splendour of his house, and the magnificence of his <span class="smcap">Library</span>." "In
regard to grounds and furniture," replied Lysander, "there is very
little in the most beautiful and costly which can long excite my
attention&mdash;but the <span class="smcap">Library</span>&mdash;" "Here," exclaimed Philemon, "here you
have him in the toils." "I will frankly confess," rejoined Lysander,
"that I am an arrant <span class="smcap">Bibliomaniac</span>&mdash;that I love books dearly&mdash;that the
very sight, touch, and, more, the perusal&mdash;" "Hold, my friend," again
exclaimed Philemon, "you have renounced your profession&mdash;you talk of
<i>reading</i> books&mdash;do <span class="smcap">Bibliomaniacs</span> ever <i>read</i> books?" "Nay," quoth
Lysander, "you shall not banter thus with impunity. We will, if it
please you," said he, turning round to me, "make our abode with you
for a few days&mdash;and, after seeing the library of your neighbour, I
will throw down the gauntlet to Philemon, challenging him to answer
certain questions which you may put to us, respecting the number,
rarity, beauty, or utility of those works which relate to the
literature and antiquities of our own country. We shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> then see who
is able to return the readiest answer." "Forgive," rejoined Philemon,
"my bantering strain. I revoke my speech. You know that, with
yourself, I heartily love books; more from their contents than their
appearance." Lysander returned a gracious smile; and the hectic of
irritability on his cheek was dissipated in an instant.</p>

<p>The approach of evening made us think of settling our plans. My
friends begged their horses might be turned into the field; and that,
while they stayed with me, the most simple fare and the plainest
accommodation might be their lot. They knew how little able I was to
treat them as they were wont to be treated; and, therefore, taking
"the will for the deed," they resolved to be as happy as an humble
roof could make them.</p>

<p>While the cloth was laying for supper (for I should add that we dine
at three and sup at nine), we took a stroll in my small garden, which
has a mound at the bottom, shaded with lilacs and laburnums, that
overlooks a pretty range of meadows, terminated by the village church.
The moon had now gained a considerable ascendancy in the sky; and the
silvery paleness and profound quiet of the surrounding landscape,
which, but an hour ago, had been enlivened by the sun's last rays,
seemed to affect the minds of us all very sensibly. Lysander, in
particular, began to express the sentiments which such a scene excited
in him.&mdash;"Yonder," says he, pointing to the church-yard, "is the
bourne which terminates our earthly labours; and I marvel much how
mortals can spend their time in cavilling at each other&mdash;in murdering,
with their pens as well as their swords, all that is excellent and
admirable in human nature&mdash;instead of curbing their passions,
elevating their hopes, and tranquillizing their fears. Every evening,
for at least one-third of the year, heaven has fixed in the sky yonder
visible monitor to man. Calmness and splendour are her attendants: no
dark passions, no carking cares, neither spleen nor jealousy, seem to
dwell in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> that bright orb, where, as has been fondly imagined, "the
wretched may have rest."&mdash;"And here," replied Philemon, "we do nothing
but fret and fume if our fancied merits are not instantly rewarded, or
if another wear a sprig of laurel more verdant than ourselves; I could
mention, within my own recollection, a hundred instances of this
degrading prostitution of talent&mdash;aye, a thousand."&mdash;"Gently reprimand
your fellow creatures," resumed Lysander, "lest you commit an error as
great as any of those which you condemn in others. The most difficult
of human tasks seems to be the exercise of forbearance and temperance.
By exasperating, you only rekindle, and not extinguish, the evil
sparks in our dispositions. A man will bear being told he is in the
wrong; but you must tell him so gently and mildly. Animosity,
petulance, and persecution, are the plagues which destroy our better
parts."&mdash;"And envy," replied Philemon, "has surely enough to
do."&mdash;"Yes," said Lysander, "we might enumerate, as you were about to
do, many instances&mdash;and (what you were not about to do) pity while we
enumerate! I think," continued he, addressing himself particularly to
me, "you informed me that the husband of poor Lavinia lies buried in
yonder church-yard; and perhaps the very tomb which now glistens by
the moonbeam is the one which consecrates his memory! That man was
passionately addicted to literature;&mdash;he had a strong mind; a
wonderful grasp of intellect; but his love of paradox and hypothesis
quite ruined his faculties. <span class="smcap">Nicas</span> happened to discover some glaring
errors in his last treatise, and the poor man grew sick at heart in
consequence. Nothing short of <i>infallibility</i> and <i>invincibility</i>
satisfied him; and, like the Spaniard in the 'Diable Boiteux,' who
went mad because five of his countrymen had been beaten by fifty
Portugese, this unhappy creature lost all patience and forbearance,
because, in an hundred systems which he had built with the cards of
fancy, ninety-nine happened to tumble to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p class="bp">"This is the dangerous consequence, not so much of vanity and
self-love as of downright literary Quixotism. A man may be cured of
vanity as the French nobleman was&mdash;'Ecoutez messieurs! Monseigneur le
Duc va dire la meillure chose du monde!'<a name="FNanchor_78_80" id="FNanchor_78_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_80" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> but for this raving,
ungovernable passion of soaring beyond all human comprehension, I fear
there is no cure but in such a place as the one which is now before
us. Compared with this, how different was <span class="smcap">Menander's</span> case! Careless
himself about examining and quoting authorities with punctilious
accuracy, and trusting too frequently to the <i>ipse-dixits</i> of good
friends:&mdash;with a quick discernment&mdash;a sparkling fancy&mdash;great store of
classical knowledge, and a never ceasing play of colloquial wit, he
moved right onwards in his manly course&mdash;the delight of the gay, and
the admiration of the learned! He wrote much and variously: but in an
evil hour the demon Malice caught him abroad&mdash;watched his
deviations&mdash;noted down his failings&mdash;and, discovering his vulnerable
part, he did not fail, like another Paris, to profit by the discovery.
Menander became the victim of over-refined sensibility: he need not
have feared the demon, as no good man need fear Satan. His pen ceased
to convey his sentiments; he sickened at heart; and after his body had
been covered by the green grass turf, the gentle elves of fairy-land
took care to weave a chaplet to hang upon his tomb, which was never to
know decay! <span class="smcap">Sycorax</span> was this demon; and a cunning and clever demon was
he!"</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_78_80" id="Footnote_78_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_80">[78]</a> This is the substance of the story related in
Darwin's <i>Zoonomia</i>: vol. iv. p. 81.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">"I am at a loss," said Philemon, "to comprehend exactly what you
mean?"&mdash;"I will cease speaking metaphorically," replied Lysander; "but
Sycorax was a man of ability in his way. He taught literary men, in
some measure, the value of careful research and faithful quotation; in
other words, he taught them to speak the truth as they found her; and,
doubtless, for this he merits not the name of a demon, unless you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
allow me the priviledge of a Grecian.<a name="FNanchor_79_81" id="FNanchor_79_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_81" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> That Sycorax loved truth
must be admitted; but that he loved no one so much as himself to speak
the truth must also be admitted. Nor had he, after all, any grand
notions of the goddess. She was, in his sight, rather of diminutive
than gigantic growth; rather of a tame than a towering mien; dressed
out in little trinkets, and formally arrayed in the faded point-lace
and elevated toupee of the ancient English school, and not in the
flowing and graceful robes of Grecian simplicity. But his malice and
ill-nature were frightful; and withal his love of scurrility and abuse
quite intolerable. He mistook, in too many instances, the manner for
the matter; the shadow for the substance. He passed his criticisms,
and dealt out his invectives, with so little ceremony, and so much
venom, that he seemed born with a scalping knife in his hand to commit
murder as long as he lived! To him, censure was sweeter than praise;
and the more elevated the rank, and respectable the character of his
antagonist, the more dexterously he aimed his blows, and the more
frequently he renewed his attacks. In consequence, scarcely one
beautiful period, one passionate sentiment of the higher order, one
elevated thought, or philosophical deduction, marked his numerous
writings. 'No garden-flower grew wild' in the narrow field of his
imagination; and, although the words decency and chastity were
continually dropping from his lips, I suspect that the reverse of
these qualities was always settled round his heart.<a name="FNanchor_80_82" id="FNanchor_80_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_82" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Thus you see,
my dear Philemon," concluded Lysander, "that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span> love of paradox, of
carelessness, and of malice, are equally destructive of that true
substantial fame which, as connected with literature, a wise and an
honest man would wish to establish. But come; the dews of evening
begin to fall chilly; let us seek the house of our friend."</p>

</div>

<p class="tp">As Lysander concluded his discourse, we turned, abruptly, but
thoughtfully, towards my cottage; and, making the last circuit of the
gravel walk, Philemon stopped to listen to the song of a passing
rustic, who seemed to be uttering all the joy which sometimes strongly
seizes a simple heart. "I would rather," exclaimed he, "be this poor
fellow, chanting his 'native wood-notes wild,' if his heart know not
guilt&mdash;than the shrewdest critic in the universe, who could neither
feel, nor write, good-naturedly!" We smiled at this ejaculation; and
quickly reached the house.</p>

<p>but they were something more rational than those of merely eating and
drinking. "I seldom partake of this meal," observed Philemon, "without
thinking of the <i>omnium-gatherum</i> bowl, so exquisitely described by
old Isaac Walton. We want here, it is true, the 'sweet shady
arbour&mdash;the contexture of woodbines, sweet-briar, jessamine, and

without; but, in lieu of all this, we have the sight of books, of
busts, and of pictures. I see there the ponderous folio chronicles,
the genuine quarto romances, and, a little above, a glittering row of
thin, closely-squeezed, curiously-gilt, volumes of original plays. As
we have finished our supper, let us&mdash;" "My friends," observed I, "not
a finger upon a book to-night&mdash;to-morrow you may ransack at your
pleasure. I wish to pursue the conversation commenced by Lysander, as
we were strolling in the garden." "Agreed," replied Philemon,&mdash;"the
quietness of the hour&mdash;the prospect, however limited, before us&mdash;(for
I shall not fail to fix my eyes upon a Froissart printed by Verard, or
a portrait painted by Holbein, while you talk)&mdash;every thing conspires
to render this discourse congenial." "As you have reminded me of that
pretty description of a repast in Walton," resumed Lysander, "I will
preface the sequel to my conversation by drinking a glass to your
healths&mdash;and so, masters, 'here is a full glass to you' of the liquor
before us." Lysander then continued, "It were to be wished that the

manner as Camden has described the air, earth, and sky, of our own

<p class="tp">"In the example of <span class="smcap">Gonzalo</span>, with whom Philemon is perfectly well
acquainted, a remarkable exemplification of the passion of <i>Vanity</i>
occurs. I recollect, one evening, he came rushing into a party where I
sat, screaming with the extatic joy of a
maniac&mdash;'<span lang="el" title="Greek: Eurêka, Eurêka">&#917;&#965;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;, &#917;&#965;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;</span>'; and, throwing down a scroll, rushed as precipitately out of
the room. The scroll was of vellum; the title to the contents of it
was penned in golden letters, and softly-painted bunches of roses
graced each corner. It contained a sonnet to love, and another to
friendship; but a principal mistake which struck us, on the very
threshold of our critical examination, was that he had incorrectly
entitled these sonnets. Friendship should have been called love, and
love, friendship. We had no sooner made the discovery than Gonzalo
returned, expecting to find us in like ecstacies with himself!&mdash;We
gravely told him that we stumbled at the very threshold. It was quite
sufficient&mdash;he seized his sonnets with avidity&mdash;and, crumpling the
roll (after essaying to tear it) thrust it into his pocket, and
retreated. One of the gentlemen in company made the following remarks,
on his leaving us: 'In the conduct of Gonzalo appears a strange
mixture of intellectual strength and intellectual debility; of wit and
dulness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span> of wisdom and folly; and all this arises chiefly from his
mistaking the means for the end&mdash;the instrument of achieving for the
object achieved. The fondest wish of his heart is literary fame: for
this he would sacrifice every thing. He is handsome, generous, an
affectionate son, a merry companion, and is, withal, a very excellent
belles-lettres scholar. Tell him that the ladies admire him, that his
mother doats on him, and that his friends esteem him&mdash;and&mdash;keeping
back the wished-for eulogy of literary excellence&mdash;you tell him of
nothing which he cares for. In truth he might attain some portion of
intellectual reputation, if he would throw aside his ridiculous
habits. He <i>must</i>, as soon as the evening shades prevail, burn wax
tapers&mdash;he must always have an Argand lamp lighted up before him, to
throw a picturesque effect upon a dark wood painted by Hobbima&mdash;his
pens must be made from the crow's wing&mdash;his wax must be green&mdash;his
paper must be thick and hot-pressed; and he must have a portfolio of
the choicest bits of ancient vellum that can be procured&mdash;his body
must recline upon a chintz sofa&mdash;his foot must be perched upon an
ottoman&mdash;in short he <i>must</i> have every thing for which no man of
common sense would express the least concern. Can you be surprised,
therefore, that he should commence his sonnet to friendship thus:</p>

<p class="center">Oh, sweetest softest thing that's friendship hight!</p>

<p>or that he should conceive the following address to women, by one
William Goddard, worthy of being ranked among the most beautiful
poetical efforts of the 16th century:</p>

Imprinted in the low countryes for all such gentlewomen as

</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>"Enough," exclaimed Philemon&mdash;while Lysander paused a little, after
uttering the foregoing in a rapid and glowing manner&mdash;"enough for this
effeminate vanity in man! What other ills have you to enumerate, which
assail the region of literature?"&mdash;"I will tell you," replied
Lysander, "another, and a most lamentable evil, which perverts the
very end for which talents were given us&mdash;and it is in mistaking and
misapplying these talents. I speak with reference to the individual
himself, and not to the public. You may remember how grievously
<span class="smcap">Alfonso</span> bore the lot which public criticism, with one voice, adjudged
to him! This man had good natural parts, and would have abridged a
history, made an index, or analyzed a philosophical work, with great
credit to himself and advantage to the public. But he set his heart
upon eclipsing Doctors Johnson and Jamieson. He happened to know a few
etymons more correctly, and to have some little acquaintance with
black letter literature, and hence thought to give more weight to
lexicographical inquiries than had hitherto distinguished them. But
how miserably he was deceived in all his undertakings of this kind
past events have sufficiently shewn. No, my good Philemon, to be of
use to the republic of literature, let us know our situations; and let
us not fail to remember that, in the best appointed army, the serjeant
may be of equal utility with the captain.</p>

<p>"I will notice only one other, and a very great, failing observable in
literary men&mdash;and this is severity and self-consequence. You will find
that these severe characters generally set up the trade of <i>Critics</i>;
without attending to the just maxim of Pope, that</p>

<p class="center">Ten censure wrong, for one that writes amiss.</p>

<p class="bp">"With them, the least deviation from precise correctness, the most
venial trippings, the smallest inattention paid to doubtful rules and
equivocal positions of criticism, inflames their anger, and calls
forth their invectives. Regardless of the sage maxims of Cicero,
Quintilian, and Horace, they not only disdain the sober rules which
their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> ancient brethren have wisely laid down, and hold in contempt
the voice of the public,<a name="FNanchor_84_86" id="FNanchor_84_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_86" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> but, forgetting the subject which they
have undertaken to criticise, they push the author out of his seat,
quietly sit in it themselves, and fancy they entertain you by the
gravity of their deportment, and their rash usurpation of the royal
monosyllable 'Nos.'<a name="FNanchor_85_87" id="FNanchor_85_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_87" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> This solemn pronoun, or rather 'plural
style,'<a name="FNanchor_86_88" id="FNanchor_86_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_88" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> my dear Philemon, is oftentimes usurped by a half-starved
little <i>I</i>, who sits immured in the dusty recess of a garret, and who
has never known the society nor the language of a gentleman; or it is
assumed by a young graduate, just settled in his chambers, and flushed
with the triumph of his degree of 'B.A.', whose 'fond conceyte' [to
borrow Master Francis Thynne's<a name="FNanchor_87_89" id="FNanchor_87_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_89" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> terse style,] is, to wrangle for an

<p class="tbp">"For my part," continued Lysander, speaking with the most unaffected
seriousness&mdash;"for my part, nothing delights me more than modesty and
diffidence, united with 'strong good sense, lively imagination, and
exquisite sensibility,'<a name="FNanchor_88_90" id="FNanchor_88_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_90" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> whether in an author or a critic. When I
call to mind that our greatest sages have concluded their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> labours
with doubt, and an avowal of their ignorance; when I see how carefully
and reverently they have pushed forward their most successful
inquiries; when I see the great Newton pausing and perplexed in the
vast world of planets, comets, and constellations, which were, in a
measure, of his own creation&mdash;I learn to soften the asperity of my
critical anathemas, and to allow to an author that portion of
fallibility of which I am conscious myself.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_88_90" id="Footnote_88_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_90">[88]</a> It is said, very sensibly, by La Bruyere, I
will allow that good writers are scarce enough; but then I
ask where are the people that know how to read and judge? A
union of these qualities, which are seldom found in the same
person, seems to be indispensably necessary to form an able
critic; he ought to possess strong good sense, lively
imagination, and exquisite sensibility. And of these three
qualities, the last is the most important; since, after all
that can be said on the utility or necessity of rules and
precepts, it must be confessed that the merit of all works
of genius must be determined by taste and sentiment. "Why do
you so much admire the Helen of Zeuxis?" said one to
Nicostratus. "You would not wonder why I so much admired it
(replied the painter) if you had my eyes."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Warton</span>: Note to

<p class="tbp">"I see then," rejoined Philemon, "that you are an enemy to
<i>Reviews</i>."<a name="FNanchor_89_91" id="FNanchor_89_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_91" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> "Far from it," replied Lysander, "I think them of
essential service to literature. They hold a lash over ignorance and
vanity; and, at any rate, they take care to bestow a hearty
castigation upon vicious and sensual publications. Thus far they do
good: but, in many respects, they do ill&mdash;by substituting their own
opinions for those of an author; by judging exclusively according to
their own previously formed decisions in matters of religion and
politics; and by shutting out from your view the plan, and real
tendency, of the book which they have undertaken to review, and
therefore ought to analyze. It is, to be sure, amusing to read the
clamours which have been raised against some of the most valuable, and
now generally received, works! When an author recollects the pert
conclusion of Dr. Kenrick's review<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> of Dr. Johnson's Tour to the
Hebrides,<a name="FNanchor_90_92" id="FNanchor_90_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_92" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> he need not fear the flippancy of a reviewer's wit, as
decisive of the fate of his publication!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_89_91" id="Footnote_89_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89_91">[89]</a> The earliest publications, I believe, in this
country, in the character of <span class="smcap">Reviews</span> were
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: the">there</span> <i>Weekly Memorials for the
Ingenious</i>, &amp;c. Lond. 1683, 4to.&mdash;and <i>The Universal
Historical Bibliotheque</i>: or an Account of most of the
considerable Books printed in all Languages, in the Month of
January 1686. London, 1687, 4to. Five years afterwards came
forth <i>The Young Student's Library</i>, by the Athenian
Society, 1692, folio, "a kind of common theatre where every
person may act, or take such part as pleases him best, and
what he does not like he may pass over, assuring himself
that, every one's judgment not being like his, another may
chuse what he mislikes, and so every one may be pleased in
their turns." Pref. A six weeks' frost is said to have
materially delayed the publication. After these, in the
subsequent century, appeared the <i>Old and New Memoirs of
Literature</i>; then, the <i>Works of the Learned</i>; upon which
was built, eclipsing every one that had preceeded it, and
not excelled by any subsequent similar critical journal,
<i>The Monthly Review</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_90_92" id="Footnote_90_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_92">[90]</a> After all, said the reviewing Doctor, we are
of opinion, with the author himself, that this publication
contains 'the sentiments of one who has seen but little:'
meaning, thereby, that the book was hardly worth perusal!
What has become of the said Dr. Kenrick now? We will not ask
the same question about the said <span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson</span>; whose works
are upon the shelf of every reading man of sense and
virtue.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">"It is certainly," pursued Lysander, "a very prolific age of
knowledge. There never was, at any one period of the world, so much
general understanding abroad. The common receptacles of the lower
orders of people present, in some degree, intellectual scenes. I mean,
that collision of logic, and corruscation of wit, which arise from the
perusal of a newspaper; a production, by-the-bye, upon which Cowper
has conferred immortality.<a name="FNanchor_91_93" id="FNanchor_91_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_93" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> You may remember, when we were driven
by a sharp tempest of hail into the small public-house which stands at
the corner of the heath&mdash;what a <i>logomachy</i>&mdash;what a <i>war of words</i> did
we hear! and all about sending troops to the north or south of Spain,
and the justice or injustice of the newly-raised prices of admission
to Covent Garden theatre!!<a name="FNanchor_92_94" id="FNanchor_92_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_94" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The stage-coach, if you recollect,
passed by quickly after our having drunk a tumbler of warm brandy and
water to preserve ourselves from catching cold; and into it glad
enough we were to tumble! We had no sooner begun to be tolerably
comfortable and composed than a grave old gentleman commenced a most
furious Philippic against the prevailing studies, politics, and
religion of the day&mdash;and, in truth, this man evinced a wonderfully
retentive memory, and a fair share of powers of argu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>ment; bringing
everything, however, to the standard of his <i>own times</i>. It was in
vain we strove to edge in the great <i>Whig and Tory Reviews</i> of the
northern and southern hemispheres! The obdurate champion of other
times would not listen a moment, or stir one inch, in favour of these
latter publications. When he quitted us, we found that he was a &mdash;&mdash;
of considerable consequence in the neighbourhood, and had acquired his
fortune from the superior sagacity and integrity he had displayed in
consequence of having been educated at the free-school in the village
of &mdash;&mdash;, one of the few public schools in this kingdom which has not
frustrated the legitimate views of its pious founder, by converting
that into a foppish and expensive establishment which was at once
designed as an asylum for the poor and an academy to teach wisdom and
good morals."</p>

manner.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_92_94" id="Footnote_92_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_94">[92]</a> It is not less true, than surprising, that the
ridiculous squabbles, which disgraced both this theatre and
the metropolis, have been deemed deserving of a regular
series of publications in the shape of numbers&mdash;1, 2, 3, &amp;c.
As if the subject had not been sufficiently well handled in
the lively sallies and brilliant touches of satire which had
before appeared upon it in the <i>Monthly Mirror</i>!</p>

<p class="tbp">Philemon was about to reply, with his usual warmth and quickness, to
the latter part of these remarks&mdash;as bearing too severely upon the
eminent public seminaries within seventy miles of the metropolis&mdash;but
Lysander, guessing his intentions from his manner and attitude, cut
the dialogue short by observing that we did not meet to discuss
subjects of a personal and irritable nature, and which had already
exercised the wits of two redoubted champions of the church&mdash;but that
our object, and the object of all rational and manly discussion, was
to state opinions with frankness, without intending to wound the
feelings, or call forth the animadversions, of well-meaning and
respectable characters. "I know," continued he, "that you, Philemon,
have been bred in one of these establishments, under a man as
venerable for his years as he is eminent for his talents and worth;
who employs the leisure of dignified retirement in giving to the world
the result of his careful and profound researches; who, drinking
largely at the fountain head of classical learning, and hence feeling
the renovated vigour of youth (without having recourse to the black
art of a Cornelius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> Agrippa<a name="FNanchor_93_95" id="FNanchor_93_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_95" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>), circumnavigates 'the Erythrean
sea'&mdash;then, ascending the vessel of Nearchus, he coasts 'from Indus to
the Euphrates'&mdash;and explores with an ardent eye what is curious and
what is precious, and treasures in his sagacious mind what is most
likely to gratify and improve his fellow-countrymen. A rare and
eminent instance this of the judicious application of acquired
knowledge!&mdash;and how much more likely is it to produce good, and to
secure solid fame, than to fritter away one's strength, and undermine
one's health, in perpetual pugilistic contests with snarling critics,
dull commentators, and foul-mouthed philologists."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_93_95" id="Footnote_93_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_95">[93]</a> Let him who wishes to be regaled in a dull
dreary night&mdash;when the snow is heavily falling, and the wind
whistles hollowly&mdash;open those leaves of Bayle's <i>Historical
and Biographical Dictionary</i> which relate to this
extraordinary character; and see there how adroitly Agrippa
is defended against the accusation of "having two devils
attending him in the shape of two little dogs&mdash;one of them
being called Monsieur, and the other Mademoiselle"&mdash;"whereas
Paulus Jovius, Thevet, &amp;c., speak only of <i>one</i> dog, and
never mention his name." Vol. i. 357, 361; edit. 1736, 10
vols. folio.
</p><p>
The bibliographer, who wishes to be master of the most
curious and rare editions of his works, may go from Bayle to
Clement, and from Clement to Vogt. He must beware of the
castrated Lyons' editions "per Beringos fratres"&mdash;against
one of which Bayle declaims, and produces a specimen (quite
to his own liking) of the passage suppressed:&mdash;another, of a
similar kind, is adduced by Vogt (edit. 1793, pp. 19, 20);
who tells us, however, that an edition of 1544, 8vo.,
without mention of place or printer&mdash;and especially a
Cologne edition of 1598, by Hierat, in 12mo.&mdash;exhibits the
like castrations; p. 20. This has escaped Clement, learned
as he is upon the Lyons' editions, vol. i. 94, 95, 96. Bauer
(<i>Bibl. Libr. Rarior.</i>) is here hardly worth consulting; and
the compilers of the celebrated <i>Nouveau Dict. Historique</i>
(Caen edit. 1789, vol. i. p. 7. Art. Agrippa) deserve
censure for the recommendation of these Lyons' editions
only.
</p><p>
Agrippa's "<span class="smcap">Vanity of Sciences</span>" was first published at
Antwerp in 4to. 1530; a book, upon the rarity of which
bibliographers delight to expatiate. His "<span class="smcap">Occult
Philosophy</span>"&mdash;according to Bayle, in 1531 (at least, the
Elector of Cologne had seen several printed leaves of it in
this year), but according to Vogt and Bauer, in 1533.&mdash;There
is no question about the edition of 1533; of which Vogt
tells us, "An Englishman, residing at Frankfort, anxiously
sought for a copy of it, offering fifty crowns (imperiales)
and more, without success." All the editions in Agrippa's
life-time (before 1536) are considered uncastrated, and the
best. It should not be forgotten that Brucker, in his <i>Hist.
Crit. Phil.</i>, has given a masterly account of Agrippa, and
an analysis of his works.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">Philemon heartily assented to the truth of these remarks; and, more
than once, interrupted Lysander in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> his panegyrical peroration by his
cheerings:<a name="FNanchor_94_96" id="FNanchor_94_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_96" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> for he had, in his youth (as was before observed), been
instructed by the distinguished character upon whom the eulogy had
been pronounced.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_94_96" id="Footnote_94_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_96">[94]</a> This word is almost peculiar to our own
country, and means a vehement degree of applause. It is
generally used previous to, and during, a contest of any
kind&mdash;whether by men in red coats, or blue coats, or black
coats&mdash;upon land, upon water, or within doors. Even the
walls of St. Stephen's chapel frequently echo to the "<i>loud
cheerings</i>" of some kind or other. See every newspaper on
every important debate.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">The effort occasioned by the warmth in discussing such interesting
subjects nearly exhausted Lysander&mdash;when it was judged prudent to
retire to rest. Each had his chamber assigned to him; and while the
chequered moon-beam played upon the curtains and the wall, through the
half-opened shutter, the minds of Lysander and Philemon felt a
correspondent tranquillity; and sweet were their slumbers till the
morning shone full upon them.</p>

is the lively description of a spring morning, in the opening of
Alain Chartier's "<i>Livre des quatre dames</i>;" and, excepting the
violets, such description conveyed a pretty accurate idea of the
scenery which presented itself, from the cabinet window, to the eyes
of Lysander and Philemon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> How delightful, my dear friend, are the objects which we have
before our eyes, within and without doors! The freshness of the
morning air, of which we have just been partaking in yonder field, was
hardly more reviving to my senses than is the sight of this exquisite
cabinet of bibliographical works, adorned with small busts and
whole-length figures from the antique! You see these precious books
are bound chiefly in Morocco, or Russia leather: and the greater part
of them appear to be printed upon <i>large paper</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Our friend makes these books a sort of hobby-horse, and
perhaps indulges his vanity in them to excess. They are undoubtedly
useful in their way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> You are averse then to the study of bibliography?</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> By no means. I have already told you of my passion for books,
and cannot, therefore, dislike bibliography. I think, with Lambinet,
that the greater part of bibliographical works are sufficiently dry
and soporific:<a name="FNanchor_95_97" id="FNanchor_95_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_97" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> but I am not insensible to the utility, and even
entertainment, which may result from a proper cultivation of
it&mdash;although both De Bure and Peignot appear to me to have gone

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> But to know what books are valuable and what are worthless;
their intrinsic and extrinsic merits; their rarity, beauty, and
particularities of various kinds; and the estimation in which they are
consequently held by knowing men&mdash;these things add a zest to the
gratification we feel in even looking upon and handling certain
volumes.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> It is true, my good Philemon; because knowledge upon any
subject, however trivial, is more gratifying than total ignorance; and
even if we could cut and string cherry-stones, like Cowper's rustic
boy, it would be better than brushing them aside, without knowing that
they could be converted to such a purpose. Hence I am always pleased
with Le Long's reply to the caustic question of Father Malebranche,
when the latter asked him, "how he could be so foolish as to take such
pains about settling the date of a book, or making himself master of
trivial points of philosophy!"&mdash;"Truth is so delightful," replied Le
Long, "even in the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> trivial matters, that we must neglect nothing
to discover her." This reply, to a man who was writing, or had
written, an essay upon truth was admirable. Mons. A.G. <span class="smcap">Camus</span>, a good
scholar, and an elegant bibliographer, [of whom you will see some
account in "<i>Les Siecles Litteraires de la France</i>,"] has, I think,
placed the study of bibliography in a just point of view; and to his
observations, in the first volume of the "<i>Memoires de l'Institut

<p><a name="Footnote_97_99" id="Footnote_97_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97_99">[97]</a> Lysander had probably the following passage
more particularly in recollection; which, it must be
confessed, bears sufficiently hard upon fanciful and
ostentatious collectors of books. "[Il y a] deux sortes de
connoissance des livres: l'une qui se renferme presque
uniquement dans les dehors et la forme du livre, pour
apprécier, d'après sa date, d'après la caractère de
l'impression, d'après certaines notes, quelquefois seulement
d'après une erreur typographique, les qualités qui le font
ranger dans la classe des livres rares où curieux, et qui
fixent sa valeur pecuniaire: l'autre genre de connoissance
consiste à savoir quels sont les livres les plus propres à
instruire, ceux où les sujets sont le plus clairement
présentés et le plus profondement discutés; les ouvrages à
l'aide desquels il est possible de saisir l'origine de la
science, de la suivre dans ses développemens, d'atteindre le
point actuel de la perfection. Sans doute il seroit
avantageux que ces deux genres de connoisances fussent
toujours réunis: l'expérience montre qu'ils le sont
rairement; l'expérience montre encore que le premier des
deux genres a été plus cultivé que le second. Nous
possédons, sur l'indication des livres curieux et rares, sur
les antiquités et les bijoux litteraires, si l'on me permet
d'employer cette expression, des instructions meilleures que
nous n'en avons sur les livres propres à instruire
foncièrement des sciences. En recherchant la cause de cette
difference, on la trouvera peut-être dans la passion que des
hommes riches et vains ont montrée pour posséder des livres
sans être en état de les lire. Il a fallu créer pour eux une
sorte de bibliotheque composée d'objets qui, sous la forme
exterieure de livres, ne fussent réellement que des raretés,
des objets de curiosité, qu'on ne lit pas, mais que tantôt
on regarde avec complaisance, tantôt en montre avec
ostentation; et comme après cela c'est presque toujours le
goût des personnes en état de récompenser qui dirige le but
des travailleurs, on ne doit pas être surpris qu'on se soit
plus occupé d'indiquer aux hommes riches dont je parle, des
raretés à acquérir, ou de vanter celles qu'ils avoient
rassemblées, que de faciliter, par des indications utiles,
les travaux des hommes studieux dont on n'attendoit aucune
récompense." <i>Memoires de l'Institut</i>, vol. i. 664. See also
the similar remarks of Jardé, in the "Précis sur les
Bibliotheques," prefixed to Fournier's <i>Dict. portatif de
Bibliographie</i>, edit. 1809.

Something like the same animadversions may be found in a
useful book printed nearly two centuries before: "Non enim
cogitant quales ipsi, sed qualibus induti vestibus sint, et
quanta pompa rerum fortunæque præfulgeant&mdash;sunt enim omnino
ridiculi, qui in nuda librorum quantumvis selectissimorum
multitudine gloriantur, et inde doctos sese atque admirandos
esse persuadent." Draudius: <i>Bibliotheca Classica</i>, ed.
1611. Epist. ad. Lect. Spizelius has also a good passage
upon the subject, in his description of Book-Gluttons
("Helluones Librorum"): "cum immensa pené librorum sit
multitudo et varietas, fieri non potest, quin eorum opibus
ditescere desiderans (hæres), non assiduam longamque
lectionem adhibeat." <i>Infelix Literatus</i>, p. 296, edit.

observations: and, at any rate, I should be better pleased with your
analysis of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> That would lead me into a wide field indeed; and, besides, our
friend&mdash;who I see walking hastily up the garden&mdash;is impatient for his
breakfast; 'tis better, therefore, that we satisfy just now an
appetite of a different kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> But you promise to renew the subject afterwards?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I will make no such promise. If our facetious friend <span class="smcap">Lisardo</span>,
who is expected shortly to join us, should happen to direct our
attention and the discourse to the sale of <span class="smcap">Malvolio's</span> busts and
statues, what favourable opportunity do you suppose could present
itself for handling so unpromising a subject as bibliography?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Well, well, let us hope he will not come: or, if he does, let us
take care to carry the point by a majority of votes. I hear the gate
bell ring: 'tis Lisardo, surely!</p>

<p>Three minutes afterwards, Lisardo and myself, who met in the passage
from opposite doors, entered the Cabinet. Mutual greetings succeeded:
and, after a hearty breakfast, the conversation was more
systematically renewed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I am quite anxious to give you a description of the fine things
which were sold at Malvolio's mansion yesterday! Amongst colossal
Minervas, and pigmy fauns and satyrs, a magnificent set of books, in
ten or twelve folio volumes (I forget the precise number) in Morocco
binding, was to be disposed of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> The Clementine and Florentine museums?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> No indeed&mdash;a much less interesting work. A catalogue of the
manuscripts and printed books in the library of the French king, Louis
the fifteenth. It was odd enough to see such a work in such a sale!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> You did not probably bid ten guineas for it, Lisardo?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Not ten shillings. What should I do with such books? You know I
have a mortal aversion to them, and to every thing connected with
bibliographical learning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> That arises, I presume, from your profound knowledge of the
subject; and, hence, finding it, as Solomon found most pursuits,
"vanity of vanities, and vexation of spirit."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Not so, truly! I have taken an aversion to it from mere whim and
fancy: or rather from downright ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> But I suppose you would not object to be set right upon any
subject of which you are ignorant or misinformed? You don't mean to
sport <i>hereditary</i> aversions, or hereditary attachments?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Why, perhaps, something of the kind. My father, who was the best
creature upon earth, happened to come into the possession of a huge
heap of catalogues of private collections, as well as of booksellers'
books&mdash;and I remember, on a certain fifth of November, when my little
hands could scarcely grasp the lamplighter's link that he bade me set
fire to them, and shout forth&mdash;"Long live the King!"&mdash;ever since I
have held them in sovereign contempt.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> I love the king too well to suppose that his life could have
been lengthened by any such barbarous act. You were absolutely a
little Chi Ho-am-ti, or Omar!<a name="FNanchor_98_100" id="FNanchor_98_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_100" class="fnanchor">[98]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span> Perhaps you were not aware that his

of Pope's works, (vol. v. 214.) might have referred us to
the very ingenious observations of Gibbon, upon the
probability of this latter event: see his "<i>Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire</i>," vol. ix. 440, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> The act, upon reflection, was no doubt sufficiently foolish. But
why so warm upon the subject?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Let me defend Philemon; or at least account for his zeal. Just
before you came in, he was leading me to give him some account of the
<span class="smcap">rise and progress of Bibliography</span>; and was fearful that, from your
noted aversion to the subject, you would soon cut asunder the thread
of our conversation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> If you can convert me to be an admirer of such a subject, or even
to endure it, you will work wonders; and, unless you promise to do so,
I know not whether I shall suffer you to begin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Begin, my dear Lysander. A mind disposed to listen attentively
is sometimes half converted. O, how I shall rejoice to see this
bibliographical incendiary going about to buy up copies of the very
works which he has destroyed! Listen, I entreat you, Lisardo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I am all attention; for I see the clouds gathering in the south,
and a gloomy, if not a showery, mid-day, promises to darken this
beauteous morning. 'Twill not be possible to attend the antiques at
Malvolio's sale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Whether the sun shine, or the showers fall, I will make an
attempt&mdash;not to convert, but to state simple truths: provided you
"lend me your ears."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> And our hearts too. Begin: for the birds drop their notes, and
the outlines of the distant landscape are already dimmed by the
drizzling rain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You call upon me as formally as the shepherds call upon one
another to sing in Virgil's eclogues. But I will do my best.</p>

<p class="bp">It is gratifying to the English nation&mdash;whatever may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span> have been the

the close of the 14th century, and tutor to Edward III. I will at
present say nothing about the merits and demerits of this short
treatise; only I may be permitted to observe, with satisfaction, that
the head of the same see, at the present day, has given many proofs of
his attachment to those studies, and of his reward of such merit as
attracted the notice of his illustrious predecessor. It is with pain
that I am compelled to avow the paucity of publications, in our own
country, of a nature similar to the <i>Philobiblion</i> of De Bury, even
for two centuries after it was composed; but while Leland was making
his library-tour, under the auspices of that capricious tyrant Henry
VIII., many works were planned <i>abroad</i>, which greatly facilitated the
researches of the learned.</p>

edition, hitherto so acknowledged, of this entertaining
work, was printed at Spires, by John and Conrad Hist, in
1483, 4to., a book of great rarity&mdash;according to Clement,
vol. v. 435; Bauer (<i>Suppl. Bibl. Libr. Rarior</i>, pt. i.
276); Maichelius, p. 127; and Morhof, vol. i. 187. Mons. De
La Serna Santander has assigned the date of 1473 to this
edition: see his <i>Dict. Bibliog. Chois.</i> vol. ii. 257,&mdash;but,
above all, consult Clement&mdash;to whom Panzer, vol. iii. p. 22,
very properly refers his readers. And yet some of Clement's
authorities do not exactly bear him out in the
identification of this impression. Mattaire, vol. i. 449,
does not appear to have ever seen a copy of it: but, what is
rather extraordinary, Count Macarty has a copy of a Cologne
edition in 4to., of the date of 1473. No other edition of it
is known to have been printed till the year 1500; when two
impressions of this date were published at Paris, in 4to.:
the one by Philip for Petit, of which both Clement and
Fabricius (<i>Bibl. Med. et Inf. Ætat.</i> vol. i. 842, &amp;c.) were
ignorant; but of which, a copy, according to Panzer, vol.
ii. 336, should seem to be in the public library at
Gottingen; the other, by Badius Ascensius, is somewhat more
commonly known. A century elapsed before this work was
deemed deserving of republication; when the country that had
given birth to, and the university that had directed the
studies of, its illustrious author, put forth an inelegant
reprint of it in 4to. 1599&mdash;from which some excerpts will be
found in the ensuing pages&mdash;but in the meantime the reader
may consult the title-page account of Herbert, vol. iii. p.
1408. Of none of these latter editions were the sharp eyes
of Clement ever blessed with a sight of a copy! See his
<i>Bibl. Curcuse</i>, &amp;c. vol. v. 438.

The 17th century made some atonement for the negligence of
the past, in regard to <span class="smcap">Richard De Bury</span>. At Frankfort his
<i>Philobiblion</i> was reprinted, with "a Century of
Philological Letters," collected by Goldastus, in 1610,
8vo&mdash;and this same work appeared again, at Leipsic, in 1674,
8vo. At length the famous Schmidt put forth an edition, with
some new pieces, "typis et sumtibus Georgii Wolffgangii
Hammii, Acad. Typog. 1703," 4to. Of this latter edition,
neither Maichelius nor the last editor of Morhof take
notice. It may be worth while adding that the subscription
in red ink, which Fabricius (<i>ibid.</i>) notices as being
subjoined to a vellum MS. of this work, in his own
possession&mdash;and which states that it was finished at
Auckland, in the year 1343, in the 58th of its author, and
at the close of the 11th year of his episcopacy&mdash;may be

<p class="tbp">Among the men who first helped to clear away the rubbish that impeded
the progress of the student, was the learned and modest <span class="smcap">Conrad Gesner</span>;
at once a scholar, a philosopher, and a bibliographer: and upon whom
Julius Scaliger, Theodore Beza, and De Thou, have pronounced noble
eulogiums.<a name="FNanchor_101_103" id="FNanchor_101_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_103" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> His <i>Bibliotheca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span> Universalis</i> was the first thing,
since the discovery of the art of printing, which enabled the curious
to become acquainted with the works of preceding authors: thus
kindling, by the light of such a lamp, the fire of emulation among his
contemporaries and successors. I do not pretend to say that the
<i>Bibliotheca</i> of Gesner is any thing like perfect, even as far as it
goes: but, considering that the author had to work with his own
materials alone, and that the degree of fame and profit attached to
such a publication was purely speculative, he undoubtedly merits the
thanks of posterity for having completed it even in the manner in
which it has come down to us. Consider Gesner as the father of
bibliography; and if, at the sale of Malvolio's busts, there be one of
this great man, purchase it, good Lisardo, and place it over the
portico of your library.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_101_103" id="Footnote_101_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_103">[101]</a> His <i>Bibliotheca</i>, or <i>Catalogus Universalis,
&amp;c.</i>, was first printed in a handsome folio volume at
Zurich, 1545. Lycosthyne put forth a wretched abridgement of
this work, which was printed by the learned Oporinus, in
4to., 1551. Robert Constantine, the lexicographer, also
abridged and published it in 1555, Paris, 8vo.; and William
Canter is said by Labbe to have written notes upon Simler's
edition, which Baillet took for granted to be in existence,
and laments not to have seen them; but he is properly
corrected by De La Monnoye, who reminds us that it was a
mere report, which Labbe gave as he found it. I never saw
Simler's own editions of his excellent abridgement and
enlargement of it in 1555 and 1574; but Frisius published
it, with great improvements, in 1583, fol., adding many
articles, and abridging and omitting many others. Although
this latter edition be called the <i>edit. opt.</i> it will be
evident that the <i>editio originalis</i> is yet a desideratum in
every bibliographical collection. Nor indeed does Frisius's
edition take away the necessity of consulting a supplement
to Gesner, which appeared at the end of the <i>Bibliothéque
Françoise</i> of Du Verdier, 1584. It may be worth stating that
Hallevordius's <i>Bibliotheca Curiòsa</i>, 1656, 1687, 4to., is
little better than a supplement to the preceding work.
</p><p>
The <i>Pandects</i> of Gesner, 1548, fol. are also well worth the
bibliographer's notice. Each of the 20 books, of which the
volume is composed, is preceded by an interesting dedicatory
epistle to some eminent printer of day. Consult Baillet's
<i>Jugemens des Savans</i>, vol. ii. p. 11. <i>Bibl. Creven.</i> vol.
v. p. 278; upon this latter work more particularly; and
Morhof's <i>Polyhistor. Literar.</i> vol. i. 197, and Vogt's
<i>Catalog. Libr. Rarior.</i>, p. 164: upon the former. Although
the <i>Dictionnaire Historique</i>, published at Caen, in 1789,
notices the botanical and lexicographical works of Gesner,
it has omitted to mention these Pandects: which however, are
uncommon.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> All this is very well. Proceed with the patriarchal age of your
beloved bibliography.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I was about resuming, with observing that our <span class="smcap">Bale</span> speedily
imitated the example of Gesner, in putting forth his <i>Britanniæ
Scriptores</i>;<a name="FNanchor_102_104" id="FNanchor_102_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_104" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> the materials of the greater part of which were
supplied by Leland. This work is undoubtedly necessary to every
Englishman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span> but its errors are manifold. Let me now introduce to your
notice the little work of <span class="smcap">Florian Trefler</span>, published in 1560;<a name="FNanchor_103_105" id="FNanchor_103_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_105" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
also the first thing in its kind, and intimately connected with our
present subject. The learned, it is true, were not much pleased with
it; but it afforded a rough outline upon which Naudæus afterwards
worked, and produced, as you will find, a more pleasing and perfect
picture. A few years after this, appeared the <i>Erotemata</i> of <span class="smcap">Michael
Neander</span>;<a name="FNanchor_104_106" id="FNanchor_104_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_106" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> in the long and learned preface to which, and in the
catalogue of his and of Melancthon's works subjoined, some brilliant
hints of a bibliographical nature were thrown out, quite sufficient to
inflame the lover of book-anecdotes with a desire of seeing a work
perfected according to such a plan: but Neander was unwilling, or
unable, to put his design into execution. Bibliography, however, now
began to make rather a rapid progress; and, in France, the ancient
writers of history and poetry seemed to live again in the
<i>Bibliotheque Françoise</i> of <span class="smcap">La Croix du Maine</span> and <span class="smcap">Du Verdier</span>.<a name="FNanchor_105_107" id="FNanchor_105_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_107" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Nor

title of "<i>Illustrium maioris Britanniæ Scriptorum, hoc est,
Anglæ, Cambriæ, ac Scotiæ summarium, in quasnam centurias
divisum, &amp;c.</i>," was printed at Ipswich, in 1548, 4to.,
containing three supposed portraits of Bale, and a spurious
one of Wicliffe. Of the half length portrait of Bale, upon a
single leaf, as noticed by Herbert, vol. iii. 1457, I have
doubts about its appearance in all the copies. The above
work was again published at Basil, by Opornius, in 1559,
fol., greatly enlarged and corrected, with a magnificent
half length portrait of Bale, from which the one in a
subsequent part of this work was either copied on a reduced
scale, or of which it was the prototype. His majesty has
perhaps the finest copy of this last edition of Bale's
<i>Scriptores Britanniæ</i>, in existence.</p>

published at Basil in 1565, 8vo. Consult <i>Polyhist. Liter.</i>

more particularly Niceron's <i>Memoires des Hommes Illustres</i>,

very excellent edition of both of them, by <span class="smcap">De La Monnoye</span> and
<span class="smcap">Juvigny</span>, in six volumes, 4to., 1772, which has realized the
patriotic wishes of Baillet, leaves nothing to be desired in
the old editions&mdash;and these are accordingly dropping fast
into annihilation. It would appear from an advertisement of
De Bure, subjoined to his catalogue of Count Macarty's
books, 1779, 8vo., that there were then remaining only
eleven copies of this new edition upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, which
were sold for one hundred and twenty livres. Claude Verdier,
son of Antony, who published a supplement to Gesner's
Bibliotheca, and a "<i>Censio auctorum omnium veterum et

declared that nothing but parental respect could have
induced him to consent to its publication&mdash;but consult the

affection; and Morhof's <i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>, vol. i., 176,
concerning the "Censio," &amp;c.&mdash;"misere," exclaims Morhof,
"ille corvos deludit hiantes: nam ubi censuram suam exercet,
manifestum hominis phrenesin facile deprehendas!" The
ancient editions are well described in <i>Bibl. Creven.</i>, vol.

industrious writer, and bishop of Tortosa, published a
quarto volume at Tarracona, in 1537, 4to.&mdash;comprehending the
following four pieces: 1. <i>De regia Sancti Lamentii
Bibliotheca</i>: 2. <i>De Bibliothecis</i> (<i>Ex Fulvio Ursino</i>,) et
<i>De Bibliotheca Vaticana (ex Omphrii Schedis)</i>: 3. <i>De
Expurgandis hæreticorum propriis nominibus</i>: 4. <i>De
Dipthycis</i>. Of these, the first, in which he treats of
collecting all manner of useful books, and having able
librarians, and in which he strongly exhorts Philip II. to
put the Escurial library into good order, is the most
valuable to the bibliographer. Vogt, p. 224, gives us two
authorities to shew the rarity of this book; and Baillet
refers us to the <i>Bibliotheca Hispana</i> of Antonio.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_107_109" id="Footnote_107_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_109">[107]</a> <span class="smcap">Mutius Panza's</span> work, under the title of

and <span class="smcap">Angelus Roccha's</span>, that of <i>Bibliotheca Apostolica
Vaticana, Rome</i>, 1591, 4to., relate rather to the ornaments
of architecture and painting, than to a useful and critical
analysis, or a numbered catalogue, of the books within the
Vatican library. The authors of both are accused by Morhof
of introducing quite extraneous and uninteresting matter.
Roccha's book, however, is worth possessing, as it is
frequently quoted by bibliographers. How far it may be
"Liber valde quidem rarus," as Vogt intimates, I will not
pretend to determine. It has a plate of the Vatican Library,
and another of St. Peter's Cathedral. The reader may
consult, also, the <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>, vol. ii., p. 141.
My copy of this work, purchased at the sale of Dr. Heath's
books, has a few pasted printed slips in the margins&mdash;some
of them sufficiently curious.</p>

vol. ii., 122, &amp;c. One of the grandest works which ever
issued from the Vatican press, under the superintendence of
Aldus, was the vulgate bible of Pope Sixtus V., 1590, fol.,
the copies of which, upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, are sufficiently well
known and coveted. A very pleasing and satisfactory account
of this publication will be found in the <i>Horæ Biblicæ</i> of
Mr. Charles Butler, a gentleman who has long and justly
maintained the rare character of a profound lawyer, an
elegant scholar, and a well-versed antiquary and
philologist.</p>

<p class="tbp">Let us here not forget that the celebrated <span class="smcap">Lipsius</span> condescended to
direct his talents to the subject of libraries; and his very name, as
Baillet justly remarks, "is sufficient to secure respect for his
work," however slender it may be.<a name="FNanchor_109_111" id="FNanchor_109_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_111" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> We now approach, with the
mention of Lipsius, the opening of the 17th century; a period
singularly fertile in bibliographical productions. I will not pretend
to describe, minutely, even the leading authors in this department.
The works of <span class="smcap">Puteanus</span> can be only slightly alluded to, in order to
notice the more copious and valuable ones of <span class="smcap">Possevinus</span> and of
<span class="smcap">Schottus</span>;<a name="FNanchor_110_112" id="FNanchor_110_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_112" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> men who were ornaments to their country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span> and whose
literary and bibliographical publications have secured to them the
gratitude of posterity. While the labours of these authors were
enriching the republic of literature, and kindling all around a love
of valuable and curious books, the <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i> of
<span class="smcap">Bolduanus</span>, and the <i>Bibliotheca Classica</i> of <span class="smcap">Draudius</span><a name="FNanchor_111_113" id="FNanchor_111_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_113" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> highly
gratified the generality of readers, and enabled the student to
select, with greater care and safety, such editions of authors as were
deserving of a place in their libraries.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_109_111" id="Footnote_109_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109_111">[109]</a> <span class="smcap">Lipsius</span> published his <i>Syntagma de
Bibliothecis</i>, at Antwerp, in 1603, 4to., "in quo de ritibus
variis et antiquitatibus circa rem bibliothecariam agitur."
An improved edition of it, by Maderus, was printed at
Helmstadt, in 1666, 4to., with other curious bibliographical
opuscula. A third edition of it was put forth by Schmid, at
the same place, in 1702, 4to. Consult Morhof. <i>Poly. Lit.</i>,
vol. i., 188.</p>

Mediol.</i>, in 8vo., 1606, editum, aliumque, cui titulus
<i>Auspicia Bibliothecæ Lovaniensis</i>, an. 1639, in 4to."
Morhof. "It is true," says Baillet, "that this Puteanus
passed for a gossipping sort of writer, and for a great
maker of little books, but he was, notwithstanding, a very
clever fellow." <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>, vol. ii., 150. In the
<i>Bibl. Crev.</i>, vol. v., 311, will be found one of his
letters, never before published. He died in 1646. <span class="smcap">Possevinus</span>
published a <i>Bibliotheca selecta</i> and <i>Apparatus sacer</i>&mdash;of
the former of which, the Cologne edition of 1607, folio, and
of the latter, that of 1608, are esteemed the most complete.
The first work is considered by Morhof as less valuable than
the second. The "<i>Apparatus</i>" he designates as a book of
rather extraordinary merit and utility. Of the author of
both these treatises, some have extolled his talents to the
skies, others have depreciated them in proportion. His
literary character, however, upon the whole, places him in
the first class of bibliographers. Consult the <i>Polyhist.
Literar.</i>, vol. i., 175. He was one of the earliest
bibliographers who attacked the depraved taste of the
Italian printers in adopting licentious capital-initial
letters. Catherinot, in his <i>Art d'imprimer</i>, p. 3, makes
the same complaint: so Baillet informs us, vol. i., pt. i.,
p. 13, edit. 1725: vol. iii., pt. 1, p. 78. <span class="smcap">Schottus's</span> work,
<i>de Bibl. claris Hispaniæ viris, France</i>, 1608, 4to., is
forgotten in the splendour of Antonio's similar production;
but it had great merit in its day. <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>,
vol. ii., pt. 1, 132, edit. 1725.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_111_113" id="Footnote_111_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_113">[111]</a> <span class="smcap">Bolduanus</span> published a <i>Theological</i> (Jenæ,
1614) and <i>Philosophico Philological</i> (Jenæ, 1616), as well
as an <i>Historical</i> (Lipsiæ, 1620), library; but the latter
work has the pre-eminence. Yet the author lived at too great
a distance, wanting the requisite materials, and took his
account chiefly from the Frankfort catalogues&mdash;some of which
were sufficiently erroneous. <i>Polyhist. Literar.</i> vol. i.,
199. See also the very excellent historical catalogue,
comprehending the 1st chap. of Meusel's new edition of
Struvius's <i>Bibl. Histor.</i>, vol. i., p. 26. <span class="smcap">Draudius's</span> work
is more distinguished for its arrangement than for its
execution in detail. It was very useful, however, at the
period when it was published. My edition is of the date of
1611, 4to.: but a second appeared at Frankfort, in 1625,
4to.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">The name of <span class="smcap">Du Chesne</span> can never be pronounced by a sensible Frenchman
without emotions of gratitude. His <i>Bibliotheca Historiarum Galliæ</i>
first published in the year 1627, 8vo.&mdash;although more immediately
useful to foreigners than to ourselves, is nevertheless worth
mentioning. Morhof, if I recollect aright, supposes there was a still
later edition; but he probably confused with this work the <i>Series
Auctorum, &amp;c. de Francorum Historia</i>;<a name="FNanchor_112_114" id="FNanchor_112_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_114" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> of which two handsome folio
editions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span> published by Cramoisy. French writers of

although we had produced some of the most learned, ingenious, and able
men in Europe&mdash;lovers and patrons of literature&mdash;yet our librarians,
or university scholars, were too lazy to acquaint the world with the
treasures which were contained in the several libraries around
them.<a name="FNanchor_113_115" id="FNanchor_113_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_115" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> You cannot expect a field-marshal, or a statesman in
office, or a nobleman, or a rich man of extensive connections,
immersed in occupations both pressing and unavoidable&mdash;doggedly to set
down to a <i>Catalogue Raisonné</i> of his books, or to an analysis of the
different branches of literature&mdash;while his presence is demanded in
the field, in the cabinet, or in the senate&mdash;or while all his bells,
at home, from the massive outer gate to the retired boudoir, are torn
to pieces with ringing and jingling at the annunciation of
visitors&mdash;you cannot, I say, my good Lisardo, call upon a person, thus
occupied, to produce&mdash;or expect from him, in a situation thus
harassed, the production of&mdash;any solid bibliographical publication;
but you have surely a right to expect that librarians, or scholars,
who spend the greater part of their time in public libraries, will
vouchsafe to apply their talents in a way which may be an honour to
their patrons, and of service to their country.<a name="FNanchor_114_116" id="FNanchor_114_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_116" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Not to walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span> with

or watch the slow progress of a melancholy crow "making wing to the
rooky wood," nor yet, in winter, to sit or stand inflexibly before the
fire, with a duodecimo jest book or novel in their hands&mdash;but to look
around and catch, from the sight of so much wisdom and so much worth,
a portion of that laudable emulation with which the Gesners, the
Baillets, and the Le Longs were inspired; to hold intimate
acquaintance with the illustrious dead; to speak to them without the
fear of contradiction; to exclaim over their beauties without the
dread of ridicule, or of censure; to thank them for what they have
done in transporting us to other times, and introducing us to other
worlds; and constantly to feel a deep and unchangeable conviction of
the necessity of doing all the good in our power, and in our way, for

reproaches cannot affect us. We are making ample amends for
past negligence; for, to notice no others, the labours of

abundantly prove our present industry. Thus speaks Senebier:
'Ill sembleroit d'abord étonnant qu'on ait tant tradé à

Genéve; mais on peut faire plus raisonnablement ce reproche
aux Bibliothécaires bien payés et uniquement occupés de leur
vocation, qui sont les dépositaires de tant de collections
précieuses qu'on voit en Italie, en France, en Allemagne, et
en Angleterre; ils le mériteront d'autant mieux, qu'ils
privent le public des piéces plus précieuses, et qu'ils ont
plusieurs aids intelligens qui peuvent les dispenser de la

Thus, in the senate, when a speaker upon one side of the

exclaim&mdash;<i>hear him, hear him!</i> And if he should happen to

it rarely comes across the search of the keenest collector.
The other, yet scarcer, productions of Naudé will be found
well described in Vogt's <i>Catalog. Libror. Rarior.</i>, p. 610.
The reader of ancient politics may rejoice in the possession
of what is called, the "<i>Mascurat</i>"&mdash;and "<i>Considerations

and Peignot (who has copied from him, without
acknowledgement&mdash;<i>Bibliogr. Curieuse</i>, pp. 49, 50,) may as
well be consulted. But the bibliographer will prefer the
"<i>Additions à l'Histoire de Louis XI.</i>," 1630, 8vo., and
agree with Mailchelius that a work so uncommon and so
curious "ought to be reprinted." See the latter's amusing
little book "<i>De Præcipuis Bibliothecis Parisiensibus</i>," pp.
66, 67, &amp;c. Naudæus was librarian to the famous Cardinal
Mazarin, the great Mæcenas of his day; whose library,
consisting of upwards of forty thousand volumes, was the
most beautiful and extensive one which France had then ever
seen. Its enthusiastic librarian, whom I must be allowed to
call a very wonderful bibliomaniac, made constant journeys,
and entered into a perpetual correspondence, relating to
books and literary curiosities. He died at Abbeville in
1653, in his 53rd year, on returning from Sweden, where the
famous Christian had invited him. Naudæus's "<i>Avis, &amp;c.</i>",
[ut supr.] was translated by Chaline; but his "<i>Avis à
Nosseigneurs du Parlement, &amp;c.</i>" 1652, 4to.&mdash;upon the sale
of the Cardinal's library&mdash;and his "<i>Remise de la</i>
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Bibliothèque"><i>Bihliothéque</i></span> [Du
Cardinal] <i>entre le mains de M. Tubeuf</i>, 1651," are much
scarcer productions. A few of these particulars are gathered
from Peignot's <i>Dict. de la</i> <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Bibliologie"><i>Bibliolologie</i></span>,
vol. ii., p. 1&mdash;consult also his <i>Dict.
Portatif de Bibliographie</i>, p. v. In the former work I
expected a copious piece of biography; yet, short as it is,
Peignot has subjoined a curious note from Naudé's
"<i>Considerations politiques</i>"&mdash;in which the author had the
hardihood to defend the massacre upon St. Bartholomew's day,
by one of the strangest modes of reasoning ever adopted by a
rational being.</p>

qui ont esté, et qui sont à présents dans le monde</i>," at
Paris, in 1644&mdash;again in 1655, 8vo.&mdash;in which he first
brought together the scattered notices relating to
libraries, especially to modern ones. His work is well worth
consultation; although Baillet and Morhof do not speak in
direct terms of praise concerning it&mdash;and the latter seems a
little angry at his giving the preference to the Parisian
libraries over those of other countries. It must be
remembered that this was published as an unfinished
production: as such, the author's curiosity and research are
highly to be commended. I have read the greater part of it
with considerable satisfaction. The same person meditated
the execution of a vast work in four folio volumes&mdash;called
"<i>La Bibliothéque universelle de tous les Autheurs de
France, qui ont escrits en quelque sorte de sciences et de
langues</i>"&mdash;which, in fact, was completed in 1638: but, on
the death of the author it does not appear what became of
it. Jacob also gave an account of books as they were
published at Paris, and in other parts of France, from the
year 1643 to 1650; which was printed under the title of

would form a little library, are reviewed by Leti with
sufficient severity: but the poor man was crack brained! And
yet some curious and uncommon things, gleaned from MSS.
which had probably never been unrolled or opened since their
execution, are to be found in this "Sciolum Florentinum," as

<span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Volante</span>, 1677, 8vo., a pretty work, with a happy
title!&mdash;being an indiscriminate account of some rare books
which the author picked up in his travels, or saw in
libraries. It was republished, with valuable additions, by
Sancassani, at Venice, in 1734, 4to. See <i>Cat. de Lomenie</i>,
N<span class="super">o</span>. 2563. Works of this sort form the <span class="smcap">Ana</span> of

work, in an epistolary form, under the title of <i>Bibliotheca
Augusta</i>; which was published at Helmstadt, in 1661,
4to.&mdash;being an account of the library of the Duke of
Brunswick, in the castle of Wolfenbuttle. Two thousand
manuscripts, and one hundred and sixteen thousand printed
volumes, were then contained in this celebrated collection.
Happy the owner of such treasures&mdash;happy the man who
describes them! <span class="smcap">Lomeier's</span>, or Lomejer's "<i>De Bibliothecis
Liber singularis</i>," Ultraj, 1669-1680, 8vo., is considered
by Baillet among the best works upon the subject of ancient
and modern libraries. From this book, Le Sieur <span class="smcap">Le Gallois</span>
stole the most valuable part of his materials for his
"<i>Traité des plus belles Bibliothéques de l'Europe</i>," 1685,
1697&mdash;12mo.: the title at full length (a sufficiently
imposing one!) may be seen in <i>Bibé. Crevenn.</i>, vol. v., p.
281; upon this latter treatise, Morhof cuttingly
remarks&mdash;"Magnos ille titulus strepitus facit: sed pro

See also "<i>Jugemens des Savans</i>," vol. ii., p. 152. Gallois
dispatches the English libraries in little more than a page.
I possess the second edition of Lomeier's book (1680&mdash;with
both its title pages), which is the last and best&mdash;and an

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Pray discuss their works, or merits, <i>seriatim</i>, as the judges
call it; for I feel overwhelmed at the stringing together of such
trisyllabic names. These gentlemen, as well as almost every one of
their predecessors, are strangers to me; and you know my bashfulness
and confusion in such sort of company.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I hope to make you better acquainted with them after a slight
introduction, and so rid you of such an uncomfortable diffidence. Let
us begin with <span class="smcap">Labbe</span>,<a name="FNanchor_122_124" id="FNanchor_122_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_124" class="fnanchor">[122]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span> who died in the year 1667, and in the
sixtieth of his own age; a man of wonderful memory and of as wonderful
application&mdash;whose whole life, according to his biographers, was
consumed in gathering flowers from his predecessors, and thence
weaving such a chaplet for his own brows as was never to know decay.
His <i>Nova Bibliotheca</i>, and <i>Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum
Manuscriptorum</i>, are the principal works which endear his memory to
bibliographers. More learned than Labbe was <span class="smcap">Lambecius</span>;<a name="FNanchor_123_125" id="FNanchor_123_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_125" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> whose
<i>Commentarii de Bibliotheca Cæsareâ-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>Vindobonensis</i>, with Nesselius's
supplement to the same, [1696, 2 vols. fol.] and Kollarius's new
edition of both, form one of the most curious and important, as well
as elaborate, productions in the annals of literature and
bibliography. Less extensive, but more select, valuable, and accurate,
in its choice and execution of objects, is the <i>Bibliotheca Hispana
Vetus et Nova</i> of Nicholas <span class="smcap">Antonio</span>;<a name="FNanchor_124_126" id="FNanchor_124_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_126" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the first, and the best,
bibliographical work which Spain, notwithstanding her fine palaces and
libraries, has ever produced. If neither Philemon nor yourself,
Lisardo, possess this latter work [and I do not see it upon the
shelves of this cabinet], seek for it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span> avidity; and do not fear
the pistoles which the purchase of it may cost you. <span class="smcap">Lipenius</span><a name="FNanchor_125_127" id="FNanchor_125_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_127" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> now
claims a moment's notice; of whose <i>Bibliotheca Realis</i> Morhof is
inclined to speak more favourably than other critics. 'Tis in six
volumes; and it appeared from the years 1679 to 1685 inclusive. Not
inferior to either of the preceding authors in taste, erudition, and
the number and importance of his works, was <span class="smcap">Adrien Baillet</span>;<a name="FNanchor_126_128" id="FNanchor_126_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_128" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> the
simple pastor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> Lardiéres, and latterly the learned and
indefatigable librarian of Lamoignon. His <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>,
edited by De la Monnoye, is one of those works with which no man, fond
of typographical and bibliographical pursuits, can comfortably
dispense. I had nearly forgotten to warn you against the capricious
works of <span class="smcap">Beughem</span>; a man, nevertheless, of wonderful mental elasticity;
but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span> for ever planning schemes too vast and too visionary for the
human powers to execute.<a name="FNanchor_127_129" id="FNanchor_127_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_129" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_122_124" id="Footnote_122_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_122_124">[122]</a> "Vir, qui in texendis catalogis totam pene
vitam consumpsit." "Homo ad Lexica et Catalogos conficiendos
a naturâ factus." Such is Morhof's account of <span class="smcap">Labbe</span>; who, in
the works above-mentioned, in the text, has obtained an
unperishable reputation as a bibliographer. The <i>Bibliotheca
Bibliothecarum</i>, thick duodecimo, or crown octavo, has run
through several impressions; of which the Leipsic edit. of
1682, is as good as any; but <span class="smcap">Teisser</span>, in his work under the
same title, 1686, 4to., has greatly excelled Labbe's
production, as well by his corrections of errata as by his
additions of some hundreds of authors. The <i>Bibliotheca
Nummaria</i> is another of Labbe's well-known performances: in
the first part of which he gives an account of those who
have written concerning medals&mdash;in the second part, of those
who have <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: published">publishe</span> separate
accounts of coins, weights, and measures. This is usually
appended to the preceding work, and is so published by
Teisser. The <i>Mantissa Suppellectilis</i> was an unfinished
production; and the <i>Specimen novæ Bibliothecæ
Manuscriptorum Librorum</i>, Paris, 1653, 4to., is too
imperfectly executed for the exercise of rigid criticism;
although Baillet calls it 'useful and curious.' Consult the
<i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>, vol. i., 197, 203: and <i>Jugemens des
Savans</i>, vol. ii., pt. 1, p. 24, edit. 1725. A list of
Labbe's works, finished, unfinished, and projected, was
published at Paris, in 1656 and 1662. He was joint editor
with Cossart of that tremendously voluminous work&mdash;the
"Collectio Maxima Conciliorum"&mdash;1672, 18 volumes, folio.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_123_125" id="Footnote_123_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_123_125">[123]</a> <span class="smcap">Lambecius</span> died at, one may almost say, the
premature age of 52: and the above work (in eight folio
volumes), which was left unfinished in consequence, (being
published between the years 1665-79 inclusive) gives us a
magnificent idea of what its author would have accomplished
[see particularly Reimanni <i>Bibl. Acroamatica</i>, p. 51] had
it pleased Providence to prolong so valuable an existence.
It was originally sold for 24 <i>imperiali</i>; but at the
commencement of the 18th century for not less than 80
<i>thaleri</i>, and a copy of it was scarcely ever to be met
with. Two reasons have been assigned for its great rarity,
and especially for that of the 8th volume; the one, that
Lambecius's heir, impatient at the slow sale of the work,
sold many copies of it to the keepers of herb-stalls: the
other, that, when the author was lying on his death-bed, his
servant maid, at the suggestion and from the stinginess of
the same heir, burnt many copies of this eighth volume
[which had recently left the press] to light the fire in the
chamber. This intelligence I glean from Vogt, p. 495: it had
escaped Baillet and Morhof. But consult De Bure, vol. vi.,
Nos. 6004-5. Reimannus published a <i>Bibliotheca
Acroamatica</i>, Hanov., 1712, 8vo., which is both an
entertaining volume and a useful compendium of Lambecius's
immense work. But in the years 1766-82, <span class="smcap">Kollarius</span> published
a new and improved edition of the entire commentaries, in
six folio volumes; embodying in this gigantic undertaking
the remarks which were scattered in his "<i>Analecta
Monumentorum omnis ævi Vindobonensia</i>," in two folio
volumes, 1761. A posthumous work of Kollarius, as a
supplement to his new edition of Lambecius's Commentaries,
was published in one folio volume, 1790. A complete set of
these volumes of Kollarius's bibliographical labours,
relating to the Vienna library, was in Serna Santander's
catalogue, vol. iv., n<span class="super">o</span>. 6291, as well as in Krohn's: in
which latter [n<span class="super">os</span>. 3554, 3562] there are some useful
notices. See my account of <a href="#Footnote_156_158">M. Denis</a>: post. Critics have
accused these "Commentaries concerning the MSS. in the
imperial library at Vienna," as containing a great deal of
rambling and desultory matter; but the vast erudition,
minute research, and unabateable diligence of its author,
will for ever secure to him the voice of public praise, as
loud and as hearty as he has received it from his abridger
Reimannus. In these volumes appeared the first account of
the Psalter, printed at Mentz in 1457, which was mistaken by
Lambecius for a MS. The reader will forgive my referring him
to a little essay upon this and the subsequent Psalters,
printed at Mentz, in 1459, 1490, &amp;c., which was published by
me in the 2nd volume of the <i>Athenæum</i>, p. 360, 490.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_124_126" id="Footnote_124_126"></a><a href="#FNanchor_124_126">[124]</a> Morhof considers the labours of <span class="smcap">Antonio</span> as
models of composition in their way. His grand work began to
be published in 1672, 2 vols., folio&mdash;being the <i>Bibliotheca
Hispana Nova</i>: this was succeeded, in 1696, by the
<i>Bibliotheca Hispana Antiqua</i>&mdash;in two folio volumes: the
prefaces and indexes contain every thing to satisfy the
hearts of Spanish Literati. A new edition of the first work
was published at Madrid, in 1783, 2 vols., folio; and of the
latter work, in 1788, 2 vols., folio.&mdash;These recent editions
are very rarely to be met with in our own country: abroad,
they seem to have materially lowered the prices of the
ancient ones, which had become excessively scarce. See
<i>Polyhist Literar.</i>, vol. i., 203-4: <i>Dictionn. Bibliogr.</i>,
vol. iv., p. 22: and <i>Mem. de l'Inst.</i>, vol. i., 651. Let us
here not forget the learned Michael <span class="smcap">Casiri's</span> <i>Bibliotheca
Arabico-Hispana Escorialensis</i>, published in two superb
folio volumes at Madrid in 1760. All these useful and
splendid works place the Spaniards upon a high footing with
their fellow-labourers in the same respectable career. De La
Serna Santander tells us that Casiri's work is dear, and
highly respected by the Literati. See <i>Cap. de Santander</i>,
vol iv., n<span class="super">o</span>. 6296.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_125_127" id="Footnote_125_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_125_127">[125]</a> The <i>Bibliotheca Realis</i>, &amp;c., of <span class="smcap">Lipenius</span>
contains an account of works published in the departments of
<i>Jurisprudence</i>, <i>Medicine</i>, <i>Philosophy</i>, and <i>Theology</i>:
of these, the <i>Bibliotheca Theologica</i>, et <i>Philosophica</i>,
are considered by Morhof as the best executed. The <i>Bibl.
Juridica</i> was, however, republished at Leipsic in two folio
volumes, 1757, with considerable additions. This latter is
the last Leipsic reprint of it. Saxius notices only the
re-impressions of 1720, 1736, 1742. See his <i>Onomast. Lit.</i>,
vol. v., 588. I will just notice the <i>Bibliotheca Vetus et
Recens</i> of <span class="smcap">Koenigius</span>, 1678, folio&mdash;as chart-makers notice
shoals&mdash;to be avoided. I had long thrown it out of my own
collection before I read its condemnation by Morhof. Perhaps
the following account of certain works, which appear to have
escaped the recollection of Lysander, may not be
unacceptable. In the year 1653, Father <span class="smcap">Raynaud</span>, whose
lucubrations fill 20 folio volumes, published a quarto
volume at Lyons, under the title of "<i>Erotemata de malis ac
bonis Libris, deque justa aut injusta eorum conditione</i>;"
which he <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: borrowed">borowed</span> in part from
the "<i>Theotimus, seu de tollendis et expurgandis malis
libris</i>," (Paris, 1549, 8vo.) of Gabriel <span class="smcap">Puhtherb</span>. Of these
two works, <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: it">if</span> were difficult to
determine which is preferable. The bibliographer need not
deeply lament the want of either: consult the <i>Polyhist.
Literar.</i>, vol. i., 177. In the year 1670, <span class="smcap">Vogler</span> published
a very sensible "<i>Universalis in notitiam cujusque generis
bonorum Scriptorum Introductio</i>"&mdash;of this work two
subsequent editions, one in 1691, the other in 1700, 4to.,
were published at Helmstadt. The last is the best; but the
second, to him who has neither, is also worth purchasing.
The seven dissertations "<i>De Libris legendis</i>" of <span class="smcap">Bartholin</span>,
Hafniæ, 1676, 8vo., are deserving of a good coat and a front
row in the bibliographer's cabinet. "Parvæ quidem molis
liberest, sed in quo quasi constipata sunt utilissima de
libris monita et notitiæ ad multas disciplinas utiles." So
speaks Morhof.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_126_128" id="Footnote_126_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_126_128">[126]</a> <span class="smcap">Adrien Baillet</span> was the eldest of seven
children born in a second marriage. His parents were in
moderate circumstances: but Adrien very shortly displaying a
love of study and of book-collecting, no means, compatible
with their situation, were left untried by his parents to
gratify the wishes of so promising a child. From his
earliest youth, he had a strong predilection for the church;
and as a classical and appropriate education was then easily
to be procured in France, he went from school to college,
and at seventeen years of age had amassed, in two fair sized
volumes, a quantity of extracts from clever works; which,
perhaps having Beza's example in his mind, he entitled
<i>Juvenilia</i>. His masters saw and applauded his diligence;
and a rest of only five hours each night, during two years
and a half of this youthful period, afforded Baillet such
opportunities of acquiring knowledge as rarely fall to the
lot of a young man. This habit of short repose had not
forsaken him in his riper years: "he considered and treated
his body as an insolent enemy, which required constant
subjection; he would not suffer it to rest more than five
hours each night; he recruited it with only one meal a
day&mdash;drank no wine&mdash;never came near the fire&mdash;and walked out
but once a week." The consequence of this absurd regime was
that Baillet had ulcers in his legs, an erysipelatous
affection over his body, and was, in other respects,
afflicted as sedentary men usually are, who are glued to
their seats from morn till night, never mix in society, and
rarely breathe the pure air of heaven. These maladies
shortened the days of Baillet; after he had faithfully
served the <span class="smcap">Lamoignons</span> as a librarian of unparalleled
diligence and sagacity; leaving behind him a "<i>Catalogue des
Matieres</i>," in 35 volumes folio. "All the curious used to
come and see this catalogue: many bishops and magistrates
requested to have either copies or abridgments of it." When
Baillet was dragged, by his friend M. Hermant, from his
obscure vicarage of Lardiéres, to be Lamoignon's librarian,
he seems to have been beside himself for joy.&mdash;"I want a man
of such and such qualities," said Lamoignon.&mdash;"I will bring
one exactly to suit you," replied Hermant&mdash;"but you must put
up with a diseased and repulsive exterior."&mdash;"Nous avons
besoin de fond," said the sensible patron, "la forme ne
m'embarasse point; l'air de ce pays, et un grain de sel
discret, fera le reste: il en trouvera ici." Baillet came,
and his biographer tells us that Lamoignon and Hermant
"furent ravis de le voir." To the eternal honour of the
family in which he resided, the crazy body and nervous mind
of Baillet met with the tenderest treatment. Madame
Lamoignon and her son (the latter, a thorough bred
bibliomaniac; who, under the auspices of his master, soon
eclipsed the book celebrity of his father) always took a
pleasure in anticipating his wishes, soothing his
irritabilities, promoting his views, and speaking loudly and
constantly of the virtues of his head and heart. The last
moments of Baillet were marked with true Christian piety and
fortitude; and his last breath breathed a blessing upon his
benefactors. He died A.D. 1706, ætatis 56. Rest his ashes in
peace!&mdash;and come we now to his bibliographical publications.
His "<i>Jugemens des Savans</i>," was first published in 1685,
&amp;c., in nine duodecimo volumes. Two other similar volumes of
<i>Anti Baillet</i> succeeded it. The success and profits of this
work were very considerable. In the year 1722, a new edition
of it in seven volumes, quarto, was undertaken and completed
by De La Monnoye, with notes by the editor, and additions of
the original author. The "Anti Baillet" formed the 8th
volume. In the year 1725, De La Monnoye's edition, with his
notes placed under the text&mdash;the corrections and additions
incorporated&mdash;and two volumes of fresh matter, including the
Anti Baillet&mdash;was republished at Amsterdam, in eight
duodecimo volumes, forming 16 parts, and being, in every
respect, the best edition of the <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>. The
curious, however, should obtain the portrait of Baillet
prefixed to the edition of 1722; as the copy of it in the
latter edition is a most wretched performance. These
particulars, perhaps a little too long and tedious, are
gleaned from the "Abregé" de la Vie de Baillet, printed in
the two last editions of the work just described.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_127_129" id="Footnote_127_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_127_129">[127]</a> It will not be necessary to notice <i>all</i> the
multifarious productions, in MS. and in print, of this
indefatigable bibliographer; who had cut out work enough for
the lives of ten men, each succeeding the other, and well
employed from morn 'till even, to execute. This is
Marchand's round criticism: <i>Dict. Hist.</i> vol. i., p. 100.
Beughem's <i>Incunabula Typographica</i>, 1688, 12mo., is both
jejune and grossly erroneous. The "<i>Bibliographia Eruditorum
Critico-Curiosa</i>," 1689, 1701, 4 vols., 12mo., being an
alphabetical account of writers&mdash;extracts from whom are in
the public literary Journals of Europe from 1665 to
1700&mdash;with the title of their works&mdash;is Beughem's best
production, and if each volume had not had a separate
alphabet, and contained additions upon additions, the work
would have proved highly useful. His "<i>Gallia Euridita</i>,"
Amst., 1683, 12mo., is miserably perplexing. In addition to
Marchand, consult the <i>Polyhist. Literar.</i> of Morhof, vol.
i., p. 179; and the note therein subjoined. See also "<i>Bibl.
Creven.</i>," vol. v., p. 298: <i>Cat. de Santander</i>, vol. iv.,

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> You have at length reached the close of the 17th century; but my
limited knowledge of bibliographical literature supplies me with the
recollection of two names which you have passed over: I mean, <span class="smcap">Thomas

relating to editions of the works of the learned.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You have anticipated me in the mention of these names. I had
not forgotten them. With the former,<a name="FNanchor_128_130" id="FNanchor_128_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_130" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> I have no very intimate
acquaintance; but of the latter I could talk in commendation till
dinner time. Be sure, my good Lisardo, that you obtain <i>both</i> editions
of the <i>Athenæ Oxoniensis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_129_131" id="FNanchor_129_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_131" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_128_130" id="Footnote_128_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_128_130">[128]</a> Sir Thomas Pope Blount's "<i>Censura
Celebriorum Authorum</i>," Londini, 1690, folio, is
unquestionably a learned work&mdash;the production of a rural and
retired life&mdash;"Umbraticam enim vitam et ab omni strepitu
remotam semper in delitiis habui,"&mdash;says its author, in the
preface. It treats chiefly of the most learned men, and
sparingly of the English. His "<i>Remarks upon Poetry</i>,"
Lond., 1694, 4to. (in English) is more frequently read and
referred to. It is a pity that he had not left out the whole
of what relates to the Greek and Latin, and confined himself
entirely to the English, poets. A life of Sir Thomas Pope
Blount will be found in the new edition of the <i>Biographia
Britannica</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_129_131" id="Footnote_129_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_129_131">[129]</a> The first, and, what Hearne over and over
again calls the genuine edition of the <i>Athenæ Oxoniensis</i>,
was published in two folio volumes, 1691, 1692. That a
<i>third</i> volume was intended by the author himself may be
seen from Hearne's remarks in his <i>Thom. Caii. Vind. Antiq.
Oxon.</i>, vol. i., p. xliii. For the character of the work
consult his <i>Rob. de Avesb.</i>, pp. xxvi, xxxiii. After the
lapse of nearly half a century, it was judged expedient to
give a new edition of these valuable biographical memoirs;
and Dr. Tanner, afterwards bishop of St. Asaph, was selected
to be the editor of it. It was well known that Wood had not
only made large corrections to his own printed text, but had
written nearly <i>500</i> new lives&mdash;his MS. of both being
preserved in the Ashmolean Museum. This new edition,
therefore, had every claim to public notice. When it
appeared, it was soon discovered to be a corrupt and garbled
performance; and that the genuine text of Wood, as well in
his correctness of the old, as in his compositions of the
new, lives, had been most capriciously copied. Dr. Tanner,
to defend himself, declared that Tonson "would never let him
see one sheet as they printed it." This was sufficiently
infamous for the bookseller; but the editor ought surely to
have abandoned a publication thus faithlessly conducted, or
to have entered his caveat in the preface, when it did
appear, that he would not be answerable for the authenticity
of the materials: neither of which were done. He wrote,
however, an exculpatory letter to Archbishop Wake, which the
reader may see at length in Mr. Beloe's <i>Anecdotes of
Literature</i>, vol. ii., p. 304. Consult the life of the
author in Mr. Gutch's valuable reprint of Wood's "<i>History
and Antiquities of the University of Oxford</i>," 1792, 4to., 2
vols.: also, Freytag's <i>Analect. Literar.</i>, vol. ii., 1105.
I have great pleasure in closing this note, by observing
that Mr. Philip Bliss, of St. John's College, Oxford, is
busily engaged in giving us, what we shall all be glad to
hail, a new and faithful edition of Wood's text of the
<i>Athenæ Oxoniensis</i>, in five or six quarto volumes.</p>

<p class="tbp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>We have now reached the boundaries of the 17th century, and are just
entering upon the one which is past: and yet I have omitted to mention
the very admirable <i>Polyhistor. Literarius</i> of <span class="smcap">Morhof</span>:<a name="FNanchor_130_132" id="FNanchor_130_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_132" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> a work by
which I have been in a great measure guided in the opinions pronounced
upon the bibliographers already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> introduced to you. This work, under a
somewhat better form, and with a few necessary omissions and
additions, one could wish to see translated into our own language. The
name of <span class="smcap">Maittaire</span> strikes us with admiration and respect at the very
opening of the 18th century. His elaborate <i>Annales Typographici</i> have
secured him the respect of posterity.<a name="FNanchor_131_133" id="FNanchor_131_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_133" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> <span class="smcap">Le Long</span>, whose pursuits
were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span> chiefly biblical and historical, was his contemporary; an able,
sedulous, and learned bibliographer. His whole soul was in his
library; and he never spared the most painful toil in order to
accomplish the various objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> of his inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_132_134" id="FNanchor_132_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_134" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> And here, my dear
friends, let me pay a proper tribute of respect to the memory of an
eminently learned and laborious scholar and bibliographer: I mean <span class="smcap">John
Albert Fabricius</span>. His labours<a name="FNanchor_133_135" id="FNanchor_133_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_135" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> shed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span> lustre upon the scholastic
annals of the 18th century; for he opened, as it were, the gates of
literature to the inquiring student; inviting him to enter the field
and contemplate the diversity and beauty of the several flowers which
grew therein&mdash;telling him by whom they were planted, and explaining
how their growth and luxuriancy were to be regulated. There are few
instructors to whom we owe so much; none to whom we are more indebted.
Let his works, therefore, have a handsome binding, and a conspicuous
place in your libraries: for happy is that man who has them at hand to
facilitate his inquiries, or to solve his doubts. While Fabricius was
thus laudably exercising his great talents in the cause of ancient
literature, the illustrious name of <span class="smcap">Leibnitz</span><a name="FNanchor_134_136" id="FNanchor_134_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_136" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> appeared as author
of a work of essential utility to the historian and bibliographer. I
allude to his <i>Scriptores Rerum Brunwicensium</i>, which has received a
well pointed compliment from the polished pen of Gibbon. After the
successful labours of Fabricius and Leibnitz, we may notice those of
<span class="smcap">Struvius</span>! whose <i>Historical Library</i><a name="FNanchor_135_137" id="FNanchor_135_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_137" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> should be in every
philological collection.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_130_132" id="Footnote_130_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_130_132">[130]</a> <span class="smcap">Daniel George Morhof</span>, professor of poetry,
eloquence, and history, was librarian of the University of
Khiel. He published various works, but the above&mdash;the best
edition of which is of the date of 1747&mdash;is by far the most
learned and useful&mdash;"liber non sua laude privandus; cum
primus fere fuerit Morhofius qui hanc am&#339;niorum literarum
partem in meliorum redigerit." <i>Vogt.</i>, pref. ix., edit.
1793. Its leading error is the want of method. His
"<i>Princeps Medicus</i>," 1665, 4to., is a very singular
dissertation upon the cure of the evil by the royal touch;
in the efficacy of which the author appears to have
believed. His "<i>Epistola de scypho vitreo per sonum humanæ
vocis rupto</i>," Kiloni, 1703, 4to.&mdash;which was occasioned by a
wine merchant of Amsterdam breaking a wine-glass by the
strength of his voice&mdash;is said to be full of curious matter.
Morhof died A.D. 1691, in his 53rd year: beloved by all who
knew the excellent and amiable qualities of his head and
heart. He was so laborious that he wrote during his meals.
His motto, chosen by himself,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pietate, Candore, Prudentia</span>,
should never be lost sight of by bibliomaniacs! His library
was large and select. These particulars are gleaned from the
<i>Dict. Historique</i>, Caen, 1789, vol. vi., p. 350.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_131_133" id="Footnote_131_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_131_133">[131]</a> A compendious account of <span class="smcap">Maittaire</span> will be
found in the third edition of my <i>Introduction to the
Knowledge of rare and valuable Editions of the Greek and
Latin Classics</i>, vol. i., p. 148. See too Mr. Beloe's
<i>Anecdotes of Literature, &amp;c.</i>, vol iii., p. ix. The various
volumes of his <i>Annales Typographici</i> are well described in
the <i>Bibl. Crevenn.</i>, vol. v. p. 287. To these may be added,
in the bibliographical department, his <i>Historia
Stephanorum, vitas ipsorum ac libros complectens</i>, 1709,
8vo.&mdash;and the <i>Historia Typographorum aliquot Parisiensium
vitas et libros complectens</i>, 1717, 8vo.&mdash;Of these two
latter works, (which, from a contemporaneous catalogue, I
find were originally published at 4<i>s.</i> the common paper,)
Mr. T. Grenville has beautiful copies upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>. The
books are rare in any shape. The principal merit of
Maittaire's <i>Annales Typographici</i> consists in a great deal
of curious matter detailed in the notes; but the absence of
the "lucidus ordo" renders the perusal of these fatiguing
and unsatisfactory. The author brought a full and
well-informed mind to the task he undertook&mdash;but he wanted
taste and precision in the arrangement of his materials. The
eye wanders over a vast indigested mass; and information,
when it is to be acquired with excessive toil, is,
comparatively, seldom acquired. Panzer has adopted an
infinitely better plan, on the model of Orlandi; and if his
materials had been <i>printed</i> with the same beauty with which
they appear to have been composed, and his annals had
descended to as late a period as those of Maittaire, his
work must have made us eventually forget that of his
predecessor. The bibliographer is, no doubt, aware that of
Maittaire's first volume there are two editions: why the
author did not reprint, in the second edition (1733), the
fac-simile of the epigram and epistle of Lascar prefixed to
the edition of the Anthology, 1496, and the Disquisition
concerning the ancient editions of Quintilian (both of which
were in the first edition of 1719), is absolutely
inexplicable. Maittaire was sharply attacked for this
absurdity, in the "Catalogus Auctorum," of the "<i>Annus
Tertius Sæcularis Inv. Art. Typog.</i>," Harlem, 1741, 8vo., p.
11. "Rara certe Librum augendi methodus! (exclaims the
author) Satis patet auctorem hoc eo fecisse concilio, ut et
primæ et secundæ Libri sui editioni pretium suum constaret,
et una æque ac altera Lectoribus necessaria esset." Copies
of the Typographical Antiquities by Maittaire, upon <span class="smcap">large
paper</span>, are now exceedingly scarce. The work, in this shape,
has a noble appearance. While Maittaire was publishing his
Typographical Annals, <span class="smcap">Orlandi</span> put forth a similar work under
the title of "<i>Origine e Progressi della Stampa o sia dell'
Arte Impressoria, e Notizie dell' Opere stampate dall' Anno
1462, sino all' Anno 1500</i>." Bologna, 1722, 4to. Of this
work, which is rather a compendious account of the several
books published in the period above specified, there are
copies upon strong <span class="smcap">writing paper</span>&mdash;which the curious prefer.
Although I have a long time considered it as superseded by
the labours of Maittaire and Panzer, yet I will not withhold
from the reader the following critique: "Cet ouvrage doit
presque nécessairement être annexé à celui de Maittaire à
cause de plusieurs notices et recherches, qui le rendent
fort curieux et intéressant." <i>Bibl. Crevenn.</i>, vol. v.,
286-7. As we are upon publications treating of Typography,
we may notice the "<i>Annalium Typographicorum selecta quædam
capita</i>," Hamb., 1740, 4to., of <span class="smcap">Lackman</span>; and <span class="smcap">Hirschius's</span>
supplement to the typographical labours of his
predecessors&mdash;in the "<i>Librorum ab Anno I. usque ad Annum L.
Sec. xvi. Typis exscriptorum ex Libraria quadam
supellectile, Norimbergæ collecta et observata, Millenarius
I.</i>" &amp;c. Noriberg, 1746, 4to. About this period was
published a very curious, and now uncommon, octavo volume,
of about 250 pages, by <span class="smcap">Seiz</span>; called "<i>Annus Tertius
Sæcularis Inventæ Artis Typographicæ</i>," Harlem, 1741&mdash;with
several very interesting cuts relating to Coster, the
supposed inventor of the art of printing. It is a little
strange that Lysander, in the above account of eminent
typographical writers, should omit to mention
<span class="smcap">Chevillier</span>&mdash;whose <i>L'Origine de l'Imprimerie de Paris, &amp;c.</i>,
1694, 4to., is a work of great merit, and is generally found
upon every bibliographer's shelf. Baillet had supplied him
with a pretty strong outline, in his short account of
Parisian printers. All the copies of Chevillier's book,
which I have seen, are printed upon what is called Foxey
paper. I believe there are none upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>. We may
just notice <span class="smcap">La Caille's</span> <i>Histoire de l'Imprimerie et de la
Librarie</i>, 1689, 4to., as a work full of errors. In order
that nothing may be wanting to complete the typographical
collection of the curious, let the "portraits of booksellers
and printers, from ancient times to our own," published at
Nuremberg, in 1726, folio&mdash;and "the Devices and Emblems" of
the same, published at the same place, in 1730, folio, be
procured, if possible. The Latin titles of these two latter
works, both by <span class="smcap">Scholtzius</span>, will be found in the <i>Bibl.
Crevenn.</i> vol. v. 281. Renouard mentions the last in his
"<i>Annales de l'Imprimerie des Alde</i>," vol. ii. p. 63.
Meanwhile the <i>Monumenta Typographica</i> of <span class="smcap">Wolfius</span>, Hamb.,
1740, 2 vols., 8vo., embraces a number of curious and
scattered dissertations upon this interesting and valuable
art. It may be obtained for 8<i>s.</i> or 10<i>s.</i> at present! The
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Am&#339;nitates"><i>Am&#339;nitatus</i></span>
<i>Literariæ, &amp;c.</i>, of <span class="smcap">Schelhorn</span> had like to have been passed
over. It was published in 14 small octavo volumes, at
Frankfort and Leipsic, from the year 1725 to 1731 inclusive.
The <i>Am&#339;nitates Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ et Literariæ</i>, of
the same person, and published at the same place in two
octavo volumes, 1738, should accompany the foregoing work.
Both are scarce and sought after in this country. In the
former there are some curious dissertations, with cuts, upon
early printed books. Concerning the most ancient edition of
the Latin Bibles, Schelhorn put forth an express treatise,
which was published at Ulm in 1760, 4to. This latter work is
very desirable to the curious in biblical researches, as one
meets with constant mention of Schelhorn's bible. Let me not
omit <span class="smcap">Zapf's</span> <i>Annales Typographiæ Augustanæ</i>, Aug. Vindel.,
1778; which was republished, with copious additions, at
Augsbourg, in two parts, 1786, 4to.&mdash;but unluckily, this
latter is printed in the German language. Upon Spanish
Typography (a very interesting subject), there is a
dissertation by Raymond Diosdado Caballero, entitled "<i>De
Prima Typographiæ Hispanicæ Ætate Specimen</i>," Rome, 1793,
4to.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_132_134" id="Footnote_132_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_132_134">[132]</a> From the Latin life of <span class="smcap">Le Long</span>, prefixed to
his <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>, we learn that he was an adept in
most languages, ancient and modern; and that "in that part
of literature connected with <span class="smcap">Bibliography</span> (Typographorum et
Librorum Historia), he retained every thing so correctly in
his memory that he yielded to few literary men, certainly to
no bookseller." Of the early years of such a man it is a
pity that we have not a better account. His <i>Bibliotheca
Sacra</i>, Paris, 1725, folio, has been republished by <span class="smcap">Masch</span>
and <span class="smcap">Boerner</span>, in four volumes, 4to., 1778, and enriched with
copious and valuable additions. This latter work is quite
unrivalled: no young or old theologian, who takes any
interest in the various editions of the Holy Scriptures, in
almost all languages, can possibly dispense with such a fund
of sacred literature. The <i>Bibliothéque Historique de la
France</i>, 1719, folio, by the same learned and industrious
bibliographer, has met with a fate equally fortunate.
<span class="smcap">Fontette</span> republished it in 1768, in five folio volumes, and
has immortalized himself and his predecessor by one of the
most useful and splendid productions that ever issued from
the press. De Bure used to sell copies of it upon <span class="smcap">large
paper</span>, in sheets, for 258 livres: according to the
advertisement subjoined to his catalogue of Count Macarty's
books in 1779, 8vo. The presses of England, which groan too
much beneath the weight of ephemeral travels and trumpery
novels, are doomed, I fear, long to continue strangers to
such works of national utility.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_133_135" id="Footnote_133_135"></a><a href="#FNanchor_133_135">[133]</a> The chief labours of Fabricius
("Vir <span lang="el" title="Greek: ellênichôtatos">&#949;&#955;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#8055;&#967;&#8061;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>"&mdash;as Reimannus truly calls him), connected
with the present object of our pursuit, have the following
titles: 1. "<i>Bibliotheca Græca, sive Notitia Scriptorum
Græcorum, &amp;c.</i>," Hamb. 1705-8-14-18, &amp;c., 4to., 14 vols.&mdash;of
which a new edition is now published by <span class="smcap">Harles</span>, with great
additions, and a fresh arrangement of the original matter:
twelve volumes have already been delivered to the public. 2.
<i>Bibliotheca Latina</i>; first published in one volume,
1703&mdash;then in three volumes, 1721, and afterwards in two
volumes, 1728, 4to.;&mdash;but the last and best edition is that
of 1773, in three vols. 8vo., published by Ernesti at
Leipsic&mdash;and yet not free from numerous errors. 3.
<i>Bibliographia Antiquaria</i>, 1716, 4to.: a new edition of
Schaffshausen, in 1760, 4to., has superseded the old one. A
work of this kind in our own language would be very useful,
and even entertaining. Fabricius has executed it in a
masterly manner. 4. <i>Bibliotheca Ecclesiastica, in quâ
continentur variorum authorum tractatus de scriptoribus
ecclesiasticis</i>, Hamb., 1718, folio. An excellent work; in
which the curious after theological tracts and their authors
will always find valuable information. It is generally
sharply contended for at book-auctions. 5. <i>Bibliotheca
Latina Mediæ et Infimæ Ætatis, &amp;c.</i>, Leipsic, 1734, 6 vols.
8vo.&mdash;again, with Schoettgenius's supplement, in 1754, 4to.,
6 vols. in 3. This latter is in every respect the best
edition of a work which is absolutely indispensable to the
philologist. A very excellent synopsis or critical account
of Fabricius's works was published at Ams., 1738, in 4to.,
which the student should procure. Let me here recommend the
<i>Historia Bibliothecæ Fabricianæ</i>, compiled by <span class="smcap">John
Fabricius</span>, 1717-24, 6 vols. 4to., as a necessary and
interesting supplement to the preceding works of John Albert
Fabricius. I have often gleaned some curious bibliographical
intelligence from its copious pages. The reader may consult
<i>Bibl. Crevenn.</i>, vol. v., 272-3.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_134_136" id="Footnote_134_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_134_136">[134]</a> He is noticed here only as the author of
"<i>Idea Bibliothecæ Publicæ secundum classes scientiarum
ordinandæ, fusior et contractior</i>," and of the "<i>Scriptores
Rerum Brunswicarum</i>," Hanov., 1707, fol., 3 vols. "The
antiquarian, who blushes at his alliance with Thomas Hearne,
will feel his profession ennobled by the name of <span class="smcap">Leibnitz</span>.
That extraordinary genius embraced and improved the whole
circle of human science; and, after wrestling with Newton
and Clark in the sublime regions of geometry and
metaphysics, he could descend upon earth to examine the
uncouth characters and barbarous Latin of a chronicle or
charter." Gibbon: <i>Post. Works</i>, vol. ii., 712. Consult also
<i>Mem. de l'Inst.</i>, vol. v., 648.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_135_137" id="Footnote_135_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_135_137">[135]</a> I will not pretend to enumerate all the
learned works of <span class="smcap">Burchard Gotthlieb Struvius</span>. His
"<i>Bibliotheca Librorum Rariorum</i>" was published in 1719,
4to. The first edition of the <i>Bibliotheca Historica</i>
appeared as early as 1705: a very valuable one was published
by Buder, in 1740, 2 vols.: but the last, and by far the
most copious and valuable, is that which exhibits the joint
editorial labours of <span class="smcap">Buder</span> and <span class="smcap">Meusel</span>, in eleven octavo
volumes, 1782, 1802&mdash;though I believe it does not contain
every thing which may be found in the edition of the <i>Bibl.
Hist. Selecta</i>, by Jugler, 1754, three vols. 8vo.: vide pp.
iv. and vii. of the preface of Meusel's edition. The <i>Bibl.
Hist. Select.</i>, by Jugler, was formerly published under the
title of <i>Introd. in notitiam rei literariæ et usum
Bibliothecæ</i>. Jugler's edition of it contains a stiff
portrait of himself in a finely embroidered satin waistcoat.
The first volume, relating to foreign libraries, is very
interesting: but, unluckily, the work is rare. Of Struvius's
<i>Bibl. Saxonica</i>, 1736, 8vo., I never saw a copy.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I thank you for the reproof. It is true, I was running

publications of <span class="smcap">Watson</span>, <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>, and <span class="smcap">Middleton</span>,<a name="FNanchor_136_138" id="FNanchor_136_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_138" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> may as well be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
admitted into your libraries, if you are partial to such works;
although upon this latter subject, the elegant quarto volume of <span class="smcap">Ames</span>
merits particular commendation.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_136_138" id="Footnote_136_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_136_138">[136]</a> Let us go gently over this <i>British</i> ground,
which Lysander depictures in rather a flowery manner. The
first edition of <span class="smcap">Bishop Nicolson's</span> <i>English Historical
Library</i> was published in the years 1696, 1697, and
1699&mdash;comprehending the entire three parts. In 1702, came
forth the <i>Scottish</i> Historical library; and in 1724, the
<i>Irish</i> Historical Library. These three libraries, with the
author's letter to Bishop Kennet in defence of the same, are
usually published in one volume; and the last and best
editions of the same are those of 1736, fol., and 1776, 4to.
Mr. John Nichols has recently published an entertaining
posthumous work of the bishop's <i>Epistolary Correspondence</i>,
in two octavo volumes, 1809. Some of these letters throw
light and interest upon the literature of the times. As to
the authority of Bishop Nicolson, in his historical matters,
I fear the sharp things which are said of his libraries by
Tyrrell (Pref. to <i>Hist. Engl.</i>, vol. ii., p. 5.), and Wood
(<i>Athen. Brit.</i>, vol. ii., col. 980, ed. 1721), all which
authorities are referred to by Mr. Nichols, are sufficiently
founded upon truth. He was a violent and wrong-headed writer
in many respects; but he had acumen, strength, and fancy.
The <i>Bibliotheca Literaria</i> of <span class="smcap">Wasse</span> (although his name does
not appear as the professed editor) is a truly solid and
valuable publication; worthy of the reputation of the
learned editor of Sallust. The work was published in
numbers, which were sold at one shilling each; but, I
suppose from the paucity of classical readers, it could not
be supported beyond the 10th number (1724); when it ceased
to be published. Some of the dissertations are very
interesting as well as erudite. <span class="smcap">Oldys's</span> <i>British Librarian</i>
was published in six numbers, during the first six months of
the year 1737; forming, with the index, an octavo volume of
402 pages. It is difficult to say, from the conclusion (p.
373-4), whether the work was dropped for want of
encouragement, or from the capriciousness or indolence of
the author: but I suspect that the ground was suffered "to
lie fallow" (to use his own words) till it was suffocated
with weeds&mdash;owing to the <i>former</i> cause: as Oldys never
suffered his pen to lie idle while he could "put money in
his purse" from his lucubrations. We shall speak of him more
particularly in <a href="#PART_V"><span class="smcap">Part v</span></a>. Meanwhile, the reader is informed
that the <i>British Librarian</i> is a work of no common
occurrence, or mean value. It is rigidly correct, if not
very learned, in bibliographical information. I once sent
three guineas to procure a copy of it, according to its
description, upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>; but, on its arrival, I found
it to be not quite so large as my own tolerably
amply-margined copy. Bishop <span class="smcap">Tanner's</span> <i>Bibliotheca
Britanico-Hibernica</i>, which cost the author forty years'
labour, was published in 1748, folio; with a preface by Dr.
Wilkins. We must receive it with many thanks, imperfect and
erroneous as many parts of it are; but I hope the period is
not very remote when a literary friend, living, as he
constantly is, in an inexhaustible stock of British
literature of all kinds, will give us a new edition, with
copious additions and corrections, translated into our
native tongue. <i>The History of the Art of Printing</i> by
<span class="smcap">Watson</span>, Edit., 1713, 8vo., is at best but a meagre
performance. It happens to be rare, and, therefore,
bibliomaniacs hunt after it. My copy of it, upon <span class="smcap">large
paper</span>, cost me 1<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> It was formerly Paton's, of
Edinburgh, a knowing antiquary in Scottish printing. The
<i>History of Printing</i>, by <span class="smcap">Palmer</span>, 1733, 4to., and Dr.
<span class="smcap">Middleton's</span> <i>Dissertations upon the same</i>, 1735, 4to., have
been particularly treated by me, as well as the similar
works of <span class="smcap">Ames</span> and <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>, in the first volume of my new
edition of Herbert's <i>British Typographical Antiquities</i>;
and the public is too well acquainted with the merits and
demerits of each to require their being pointed out in the
present place. I will close this note by observing that the
<i>Censuria Literaria</i>, in ten volumes octavo; and the
<i>British Bibliographer</i> (now publishing) which grew out of
it; Mr. <span class="smcap">Beloe's</span> <i>Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books</i>,
six volumes, 8vo.; and Mr. Savage's continuation of <i>The
British Librarian</i>; are works which render the list of
English publications, relating to typography and curious
books, almost complete. I believe I may safely affirm that
the period is not very distant when some of these latter
publications, from the comparatively few copies which were
struck off, will become very rare.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I am glad to hear such handsome things said of the performances
of our own countrymen. I was fearful, from your frequent sly
allusions, that we had nothing worth mentioning. But proceed with your
Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You draw too severe a conclusion. I have made no sly
allusions. My invariable love of truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span> impels me to state facts as
they arise. That we have philosophers, poets, scholars, divines,
lovers and collectors of books, equal to those of any nation upon
earth is most readily admitted. But bibliography has never been, till
now, a popular (shall I say fashionable?) pursuit amongst the English.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Well, if what you call bibliography has produced such eminent
men, and so many useful works, as those which have been just
enumerated, I shall begin to have some little respect for this
department of literature; and, indeed, I already feel impatient to go
through the list of your bibliographical heroes.&mdash;Who is the next
champion deserving of notice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> This confession gives me sincere pleasure. Only indulge me in
my rambling manner of disquisition, and I will strive to satisfy you
in every reasonable particular.</p>

<p class="bp">If ever you should be disposed to form a bibliographical collection,
do not omit securing, when it comes across you, the best edition of Du
Fresnoy's<a name="FNanchor_137_139" id="FNanchor_137_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_139" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> <i>Methode pour étudier l'Histoire</i>: it is rare, and

of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span> choicest materials, and whose devotion to literature and
history has been a general theme of admiration and praise. The mention
of this illustrious name, in such a manner, has excited in my mind a
particular train of ideas. Let me, therefore, in imagination, conduct
you both to yonder dark avenue of trees&mdash;and, descending a small
flight of steps, near the bottom of which gushes out a salient
stream&mdash;let us enter a spacious grotto, where every thing is cool and
silent; and where small alabaster busts, of the greater number of
those bibliographers I am about to mention, decorate the niches on
each side of it. How tranquil and how congenial is such a resting
place!&mdash;But let us pursue our inquires. Yonder sharp and well turned
countenances, at the entrance of the grotto, are fixed there as
representations of <span class="smcap">Cardinal Quirini</span><a name="FNanchor_139_141" id="FNanchor_139_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_141" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and <span class="smcap">Goujet</span>; the <i>Bibliothéque

collectors, in general, to have a more intimate acquaintance&mdash;has
obtained universal reputation.<a name="FNanchor_140_142" id="FNanchor_140_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_142" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Next to him, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> may mark the

<i>Bibliothéque Curieuse</i>, has shown us how he could rove, like a bee,
from flower to flower; sip what was sweet; and bring home his
gleanings to a well-furnished hive. The principal fault of this bee
(if I must keep up the simile) is that he was not sufficiently choice
in the flowers which he visited; and, of course, did not always
extract the purest honey. Nearly allied to Clement in sprightliness,
and an equally gossipping bibliographer, was <span class="smcap">Prosper Marchand</span>;<a name="FNanchor_142_144" id="FNanchor_142_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_144" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> works present us with some things no where else to be found,
and who had examined many curious and rare volumes; as well as made
himself thoroughly acquainted with the state of bibliography previous
to his own times.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_137_139" id="Footnote_137_139"></a><a href="#FNanchor_137_139">[137]</a> The last edition of this work is the one
which was printed in fifteen volumes, crown 8vo., at Paris,
1772: with a copious index&mdash;and proportionable improvements
in corrections and additions. It is now rare. I threw out
the old edition of 1729, four vols., 4to., upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>;
and paid three guineas to boot for the new one, neatly
bound.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_138_140" id="Footnote_138_140"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138_140">[138]</a> It is quite delightful to read the account,

475) of <span class="smcap">Jean Pierre Niceron</span>; whose whole life seems to have
been devoted to bibliography and literary history. Frank,
amiable, industrious, communicative, shrewd, and
learned&mdash;Niceron was the delight of his friends, and the
admiration of the public. His "<i>Memoires pour servir à
l'Histoire des Hommes Illustres, &amp;c., avec un Catalogue
raisonné de leur Ouvrages</i>," was published from the years
1729 to 1740, in forty crown 8vo. volumes. A supplement of
three volumes, the latter of which is divided into <i>two
parts</i>, renders this very useful, and absolutely necessary,
work complete in 44 volumes. The bibliomaniac can never
enjoy perfect rest till he is in possession of it!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_139_141" id="Footnote_139_141"></a><a href="#FNanchor_139_141">[139]</a> <span class="smcap">Quirini</span> published his "<i>Specimen variæ
Literaturæ quæ in urbe Brixiæ ejusque Ditione paulo post

1739; two vols., 8vo.: then followed "<i>Catalogo delle Opere
del Cardinale Quirini uscite alla luce quasi tuttee da'
Torchi di mi Gian Maria Rizzardi Stampatore in Brescia</i>,"
8vo. In 1751, Valois addressed to him his "<i>Discours sur les
Bibliothéques Publiques</i>," in 8vo.: his Eminence's reply to
the same was also published in 8vo. But the Cardinal's chief
reputation, as a bibliographer, arises from the work
entitled "<i>De Optimorum Scriptorum Editionibus</i>." Lindaugiæ,
1761, 4to. This is Schelhorn's edition of it, which is
chiefly coveted, and which is now a rare book in this
country. It is a little surprising that Lysander, in his
love of grand national biographical works, mingled with
bibliographical notices, should have omitted to mention the
<i>Bibliotheca Lusitana</i> of Joaov and Barbosa, published at
Lisbon, 1741, in four magnificent folio volumes. A lover of
Portuguese literature will always consider this as "opus
splendidissimum et utilissimum."</p>

volumes, crown 8vo., 1741, like the similar work of Niceron,
is perhaps a little too indiscriminate in the choice of its
objects: good, bad, and indifferent authors being enlisted
into the service. But it is the chéf-d'&#339;uvre of Goujet,
who was a man of wonderful parts; and no bibliographer can
be satisfied without it. Goujet was perhaps among the most
learned, if not the "facile princeps," of those who
cultivated ancient French literature. He liberally assisted
Niceron in his Memoires, and furnished Moreri with 2000
corrections for his Dictionary.</p>

Hanover, and Leipsic, in 9 quarto volumes, from the year
1750 to 1760&mdash;is, unfortunately, an unfinished production;
extending only to the letter H. The reader may find a
critique upon it in my <i>Introduction to the Greek and Latin
Classics</i>, vol. i., p. 370; which agrees, for the greater
part, with the observations in the <i>Bibl. Crevenn.</i>, vol.
v., 290. The work is a <i>sine quâ non</i> with collectors; but
in this country it begins to be&mdash;to use the figurative
language of some of the German bibliographers&mdash;"scarcer than
a white crow,"&mdash;or "a black swan." The reader may admit
which simile he pleases&mdash;or reject both! But, in sober
sadness, it is very rare, and unconscionably dear. I know
not whether it was the same <span class="smcap">Clement</span> who published "<i>Les cinq
Années Littéraires, ou Lettres de M. Clément, sur les
ouvrages de Littérature, qui ont parus dans les Années
1748&mdash;á 1752</i>;" Berlin, 1756, 12mo., two volumes. Where is
the proof of the assertion, so often repeated, that Clement
borrowed his notion of the above work from <span class="smcap">Wendler's</span>
<i>Dissertatio de variis raritatis librorum impressorum
causis</i>, Jen., 1711, 4to.?&mdash;Wendler's book is rare among us:

<p><a name="Footnote_142_144" id="Footnote_142_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_142_144">[142]</a> The principal biographical labours of this
clever man have the following titles: "<i>Histoire de
l'Imprimerie</i>," La Haye, 1740, 4to.&mdash;an elegant and
interesting volume, which is frequently consulted by
typographical antiquaries. Of <span class="smcap">Mercier's</span> supplement to it,
see note in the ensuing pages under the word "Mercier." His
"<i>Dictionnaire Historique, ou Memoires Critiques et
Littéraires</i>," in two folio volumes, 1758, was a posthumous
production; and a very extraordinary and amusing
bibliographical common-place book it is! My friend Mr.
Douce, than whom few are better able to appreciate such a
work, will hardly allow any one to have a warmer attachment
to it, or a more thorough acquaintance with its contents,
than himself&mdash;and yet there is no bibliographical work to
which I more cheerfully or frequently turn! In the editor's
advertisement we have an interesting account of Marchand:
who left behind, for publication, a number of scraps of
paper, sometimes no bigger than one's nail; upon which he
had written his remarks in so small a hand-writing that the
editor and printer were obliged to make use of a strong
magnifying glass to decypher it&mdash;"et c'est ici (continues
the former) sans doute le premier livre qui n'ait pu être
imprimé sans le secours continuel du Microscope." Marchand
died in 1753, and left his MSS. and books, in the true
spirit of a bibliomaniac, to the University of Leyden. I
see, from the conclusion of this latter authority, that a
new edition of Marchand's History of Printing was in
meditation to be published, after the publication of the
Dictionary. Whether Mercier availed himself of Marchand's
corrected copy, when he put forth his supplement to the
latter's typographical history, I have no means of
ascertaining. Certainly there never was a second edition of
the <i>Histoire de l'Imprimerie</i>, by

a sort of bibliographical emporium, where the idle and the diligent

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_143_145" id="Footnote_143_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143_145">[143]</a> The earliest edition of <span class="smcap">Vogt's</span> <i>Catalogus
Librorum Rariorum</i> was published in 1732; afterwards in
1737; again in 1748; again in 1752, much enlarged and
improved; and, for the last time, greatly enlarged and
corrected, forming by far the "editio optima," of the
work&mdash;at Frankfort and Leipsic, 1793, 8vo.&mdash;We are told, in
the new preface to this last edition, that the second and
third impressions were quickly dispersed and anxiously
sought after. Vogt is a greater favourite with me than with
the generality of bibliographers. His plan, and the
execution of it, are at once clear and concise; but he is
too prodigal of the term "rare." Whilst these editions of
Vogt's amusing work were coming forth, the following
productions were, from time to time, making their
appearance, and endeavouring perhaps to supplant its
reputation. First of all <span class="smcap">Beyer</span> put forth his <i>Memoriæ
Historico-Criticæ Librorum Rariorum</i>. Dresd. and Lips.,
1734, 8vo.; as well <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: as">has</span> his <i>Arcana
Sacra Bibliothecarum Dresdensium</i>, 1738, 8vo.&mdash;with a
continuation to the latter, preceded by an epistle
concerning the electoral library, separately published in
the same year. Then <span class="smcap">Engel</span> (in Republicâ Helveto-Bernensi
Bibliothecarius primus) published his <i>Bibliotheca
selectissima, sive Catalogus librorum in omni genere
scientiarum rarissimorum</i>, &amp;c., Bernæ, 1743, 8vo.; in which
work some axioms are laid down concerning the rarity of
books not perhaps sufficiently correct; but in which a great
deal of curious matter, very neatly executed, will repay the
reader for any expense he may incur in the purchase of it.
Afterwards <span class="smcap">Freytag's</span> <i>Analecta Literaria de libris
rarioribus</i>, Lips., 1750, two vols. 8vo.;&mdash;and his
<i>Adparatus Literarius ubi libri partim antiqui partim rari
recensentur</i>, Lipsiæ, 1755, three volumes 8vo., highly
gratified the curious in bibliography. In the former work
the books are described alphabetically, which perhaps is the
better plan: in the latter, they are differently arranged,
with an alphabetical index. The latter is perhaps the more
valuable of the two, although the former has long been a
great favourite with many; yet, from Freytag's own
confession, he was not then so knowing in books, and had not
inspected the whole of what he described. They are both
requisite to the collector; and their author, who was an
enthusiast in bibliography, ranks high in the literature of
his country. In the last place we may notice the
<i>Florilegium Historico-Criticum Librorum Rariorum, cui multa
simul scitu jucunda intersperguntur</i>, &amp;c., of <span class="smcap">Daniel Gerdes</span>;
first published at Groningen, in 1740; but afterwards in
1763, 8vo., at the same place, the third and best edition.
It was meant, in part, to supply the omission of some rare
books in Vogt: and under this title it was published in the
<i>Miscellaneæ Groninganæ</i>, vol. ii., and vol. iii. This work
of Gerdes should have a convenient place in every
bibliographical cabinet. I will close this attempt to supply
Lysander's omission of some very respectable names connected
with bibliography by exhorting the reader to seize hold of a
work (whenever it comes across him, which will be rarely)
entitled <i>Bibliotheca Librorum Rariorum Universalis</i>, by
<span class="smcap">John Jacob Bauer</span>, a bookseller at Nuremberg, and printed
there in 1770, 8vo., two vols.; with three additional
volumes by way of Supplement, 1774-1791, which latter are
usually bound in one. It is an alphabetical Dictionary, like
Vogt's and Fournier's, of what are called rare books. The
descriptions are compendious, and the references
respectable, and sometimes numerous. My copy of this scarce,
dear, and wretchedly-printed, work, which is as large and
clean as possible, and bound in pale Russia, with marbled
edges to the leaves&mdash;cost me 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_144_146" id="Footnote_144_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_144_146">[144]</a> We are indebted to <span class="smcap">Pierre Simon Fournier</span> le
jeune, for some very beautiful interesting little volumes
connected with engraving and printing. 1. <i>Dissertation sur
l'Origine et les Progrés de l'art de Graver en Bois, &amp;c.</i>,
Paris, 1758, 8vo. 2. <i>De l'Origine et des Productions de
l'Imprimerie primitive en taille de bois</i>, Paris, 1759, 8vo.
3. <i>Traité sur l'Origine et les Progrés de l'Imprimerie</i>,
Paris, 1764. 4. <i>Observations sur un Ouvrage intitulé
Vindiciæ Typographicæ</i>, Paris, 1760. These treatises are
sometimes bound in one volume. They are all elegantly
printed, and rare. We may also mention&mdash;5. <i>Epreuves de deux
petits caractères nouvellement gravès, &amp;c.</i>, Paris, 1757;
and especially his chef-d'&#339;uvre. 6. <i>Manuel
Typographique</i>, Paris, 1764-6, 8vo., two vols.: of which
some copies want a few of the cuts: those upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>
(there is one of this kind in the Cracherode collections)
are of the first rarity. Fournier's typographical manual
should be in every printing office: his types "are the
models (says his namesake,) of those of the best printed
books at Paris at this day." <i>Dict. Port. de Bibliogr.</i>, p.
218, edit. 1706.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_145_147" id="Footnote_145_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_145_147">[145]</a> The <i>Origines Typographicæ</i> of <span class="smcap">Meerman</span>, which
was published at the Hague in two handsome quarto volumes,
1765, (after the plan or prospectus had been published in
1761, 8vo.), secured its author a very general and rather
splendid reputation, till the hypothesis advanced therein,
concerning Laurence Coster, was refuted by Heinecken. The
reader is referred to a note in the first volume of my new
edition of the <i>Typographical Antiquities of Great Britain</i>,
p. xxxi. It is somewhat singular that, notwithstanding
Meerman's hypothesis is now exploded by the most knowing
bibliographers, his dissertation concerning the claims of
Haerlem should have been reprinted in French, with useful
notes, and an increased catalogue of all the books published
in the Low Countries, during the 15th century. This latter
work is entitled "<i>De l'Invention de l'Imprimerie, ou

of Meerman. Lysander might have noticed, with the encomium
which it justly merits the <i>Vindiciæ Typographicæ</i> of
<span class="smcap">Schoepflin</span>, printed at Strasburg, in 1760, 4to.; where the
claimes of Gutenburg (a native of the same city) to the
invention of the typographic art are very forcibly and
successfully maintained.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_147_149" id="Footnote_147_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_149">[147]</a> The works of <span class="smcap">Guillaume-François de Bure</span>
deserve a particular notice. He first published his <i>Musæum
Typographicum</i>, Paris, 1755, 12mo.; of which he printed but
<span class="smcap">twelve</span> copies, and gave away every one of them (including
even his own) to his book-loving friends. It was published
under the name of G.F. Rebude. Peignot is very particular in
his information concerning this rare morçeau of
bibliography&mdash;see his <i>Bibliographie Curieuse</i>, p. 21.
Afterwards appeared the <i>Bibliographie Instructive</i>, in
seven volumes, 8vo., 1763-68&mdash;succeeded by a small volume of
a catalogue of the anonymous publications, and an essay upon
Bibliography: this 8th volume is absolutely necessary to
render the work complete, although it is frequently missing.
Fifty copies of this work were printed upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, of
a quarto size. Its merits are acknowledged by every candid
and experienced critic. In the third place, came forth his
<i>Catalogue des Livres, &amp;c., de L.J. Gaignat, Paris</i>, 1769,
8vo., two vols.: not, however, before he had published two
brochures&mdash;"<i>Appel aux Savans</i>," <i>&amp;c.</i>, 1763, 8vo.&mdash;and
"<i>Reponse à une Critique de la Bibliographie Instructive</i>,"
1763, 8vo.&mdash;as replies to the tart attacks of the Abbé <span class="smcap">Rive</span>.
The Catalogue of Gaignat, and the fairness of his answers to
his adversary's censures, served to place De Bure on the
pinnacle of bibliographical reputation; while Rive was
suffered to fret and fume in unregarded seclusion. He died
in the year 1782, aged 50: and was succeeded in his
bibliographical labours by his cousin <span class="smcap">William</span>; who, with
Mons. Van-Praet, prepared the catalogue of the Duke de la
Valliere's library, in 1783, and published other valuable
catalogues as late as the year 1801. But both are eclipsed,
in regard to the <i>number</i> of such publications, by their
predecessor <span class="smcap">Gabriel Martin</span>; who died in the year 1761, aged
83&mdash;after having compiled 148 catalogues since the year
1705. This latter was assisted in his labours by his son
Claude Martin, who died in 1788. See Peignot's <i>Dict. de
Bibliologie</i>, vol. i., 221, 422: vol iii., 277.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_148_150" id="Footnote_148_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148_150">[148]</a> The mention of De Bure and the Abbé <span class="smcap">Rive</span>
induces me to inform the reader that the <i>Chasse aux
Bibliographes</i>, Paris, 1789, 8vo., of the latter, will be
found a receptacle of almost every kind of gross abuse and
awkward wit which could be poured forth against the
respectable characters of the day. It has now become rare.
The Abbé's "<i>Notices calligraphiques et typographiques</i>," a
small tract of 16 pages&mdash;of which only 100 copies were
printed&mdash;is sufficiently curious; it formed the first number
of a series of intended volumes (12 or 15) "<i>des notices
calligraphiques de manuscrits des differens siécles, et des
notices typographiques de livres du quinziéme siécle</i>," but
the design was never carried into execution beyond this
first number. The other works of Rive are miscellaneous; but
chiefly upon subjects connected with the belles lettres. He
generally struck off but few copies of his publications; see
the <i>Bibliographie Curieuse</i>, pp. 58-9; and more
particularly the <i>Dictionnaire de Bibliologie</i>, vol. iii.,
p. 277, by the same author, where a minute list of Rive's
productions is given, and of which Fournier might have
availed himself in his new edition of the <i>Dict. Portatif de
Bibliographie</i>. From Peignot, the reader is presented with
the following anecdotes of this redoubted champion of
bibliography. When Rive was a young man, and curate of
Mollèges in Provence, the scandalous chronicle reported that
he was too intimate with a young and pretty Parisian, who
was a married woman, and whose husband did not fail to
reproach him accordingly. Rive made no other reply than that
of taking the suspicious Benedick in his arms, and throwing
him headlong out of the window. Luckily he fell upon a
dunghill! In the year 1789, upon a clergyman's complaining
to him of the inflexible determination of a great lord to
hunt upon his grounds&mdash;"<i>Mettez-lui une messe dans le
ventre</i>"&mdash;<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: replied">repiled</span> Rive. The
clergyman expressing his ignorance of the nature of the
advice given, the facetious Abbé replied, "Go and tear a
leaf from your <i>mass book</i>, wrap a musket-ball in it, and
discharge it at the tyrant." The Duke de la Valliere used to
say&mdash;when the knowing ones at his house were wrangling about
some literary or bibliographical point&mdash;"Gentlemen, I'll go
and let loose my bull dog,"&mdash;and sent into them the Abbé,
who speedily put them all to rights. Rive died in the year
1791, aged seventy-one. He had great parts and great
application; but in misapplying both he was his own
tormentor. His library was sold in 1793.</p>

<p class="tbp">Next to the bust of De Bure, consider those of the five Italian
bibliographers and literati, <span class="smcap">Haym</span>, <span class="smcap">Fontanini</span>, <span class="smcap">Zeno</span>, <span class="smcap">Mazzuchelli</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Tiraboschi</span>; which are placed in the five consecutive niches. Their
works are of various merit, but are all superior to that of their
predecessor <span class="smcap">Doni</span>. Although those of the first three authors should
find a place in every bibliographical collection, the productions of
Mazzuchelli,<a name="FNanchor_149_151" id="FNanchor_149_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_151" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and especially of the immortal Tiraboschi, cannot
fail to be admitted into every judicious library, whether vast or
confined. Italy boasts of few literary characters of a higher class,
or of a more widely-diffused reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span> than <span class="smcap">Tiraboschi</span>.<a name="FNanchor_150_152" id="FNanchor_150_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_152" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> His
diligence, his sagacity, his candour, his constant and patriotic
exertions to do justice to the reputation of his countrymen, and to
rescue departed worth from ill-merited oblivion, assign to him an
exalted situation: a situation with the Poggios and Politians of
former times, in the everlasting temple of Fame! Bind his <i>Storia
della Letteratura Italiana</i> in the choicest vellum, or in the stoutest
Russia; for it merits no mean covering!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_149_151" id="Footnote_149_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_149_151">[149]</a> We may first observe that "<i>La Libraria del</i>
<span class="smcap">Doni</span> <i>Fiorentino</i>;" Vinegia, 1558, 8vo., is yet coveted by
collectors as the most complete and esteemed of all the
editions of this work. It is ornamented with many portraits
of authors, and is now rare. Consult <i>Bibl. Crevenn.</i>, vol.
v., p. 275. Numerous are the editions of <span class="smcap">Haym's</span> <i>Biblioteca
Italiana</i>; but those of Milan, of the date of 1771, 4to., 2
vols., and 1803, 8vo. 4 vols., are generally purchased by
the skilful in Italian bibliography. The best edition of
<span class="smcap">Fontanini's</span> <i>Biblioteca dell' Eloquenza Italiana</i> is with
the annotations of <span class="smcap">Zeno</span>, which latter are distinguished for
their judgment and accuracy. It was published at Venice in
1753, 4to., 2 vols.; but it must be remembered that this
edition contains only the <i>third</i> book of Fontanini, which
is a library of the principal Italian authors. All the three
books (the first two being a disquisition upon the
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: origin">orgin</span> and progress of the Italian
language) will be found in the
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: preceding">preceeding</span> Venice edition of 1737, in one volume 4to.
In the year 1753-63, came forth the incomparable but
unfinished work of <span class="smcap">Count Mazzuchelli</span>, in two folio volumes,
[the latter vol. being divided into four thick parts]
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: entitled">entittled</span>: <i>Gli Scrittori
d'Italia, cioé Notizie Storiche e Critiche intorno alle Vite
e agli Scritti dei Letterati Italiani</i>. The death of the
learned author prevented the publication of it beyond the
first two letters of the alphabet. The Count, however, left
behind ample materials for its execution according to the
original plan, which lay shamefully neglected as late as the
year 1776. See <i>Bibl. Crevenn.</i>, vol. v., p. 274. This work
is rare in our own country. If the lover of Italian
philology wishes to increase his critico-literary stores,
let him purchase the <i>Biblioteca degli Autori Antichi Greci,
e Latini volgarizzati</i>, &amp;c., of <span class="smcap">Paitoni</span>, in five quarto
volumes, 1766: the <i>Notizie Istorico-Critiche &amp;c.,</i>
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: corrected printer error in original; 'degli' was misplaced"><i>degli</i></span> <i>Scrittori Viniziani</i>,
of <span class="smcap">Agostini</span>, Venez., 1752, 4to., 2 vols.: and the
<i>Letteratura Turchesca of</i> <span class="smcap">Giambatista Toderini</span>, Venez.,
1787, 8vo., 3 vols.&mdash;works nearly perfect of their kind, and
(especially the latter one) full of curious matter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_150_152" id="Footnote_150_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_150_152">[150]</a> The best edition of his <i>Letteratura
Italiana</i> is that of Modena, 1787-94, 4to., in fifteen
volumes, as it contains his last corrections and additions,
and has the advantage of a complete index. An excellent
account of the life and labours of its wonderful author
appeared in the fifth volume of the <i>Athenæum</i>, to the
perusal of which I strongly recommend the reader.</p>

<p class="tbp">The range of busts which occupies the opposite niches represents
characters of a more recent date. Let us begin with <span class="smcap">Mercier</span>;<a name="FNanchor_151_153" id="FNanchor_151_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_153" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> a
man of extraordinary, and almost unequalled, knowledge in every thing
connected with bibliography and typography; of a quick apprehension,
tenacious memory, and correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span> judgment; who was more anxious to
detect errors in his own publications than in those of his fellow
labourers in the same pursuit; an enthusiast in typographical
researches&mdash;the Ulysses of bibliographers! Next to him stand the
interesting busts of <span class="smcap">Saxius</span> and <span class="smcap">Laire</span>;<a name="FNanchor_152_154" id="FNanchor_152_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_154" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> the latter of whom has
frequently erred, but who merited not such a castigation as subsequent
bibliographers have attempted to bestow upon him: in the number of
which, one is sorry to rank the very respectable name of
<span class="smcap">Audiffredi</span><a name="FNanchor_153_155" id="FNanchor_153_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_155" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>&mdash;whose bust, you observe, immediately follows that of
Laire. Audiffredi has left behind him a most enviable reputation: that
of having examined libraries with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> curious eye, and described the
various books which he saw with scrupulous fidelity. There are no
lively or interesting sallies, no highly-wrought, or tempting
descriptions&mdash;throughout his two quarto volumes: but, in lieu of this,
there is sober truth, and sound judgment. I have mentioned Audiffredi
a little out of order, merely because his name is closely connected
with that of Laire: but I should have first directed your attention to
the sagacious countenance of <span class="smcap">Heinecken</span>;<a name="FNanchor_154_156" id="FNanchor_154_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_156" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> whose work upon ancient
printing, and whose <i>Dictionary of Engravers</i> (although with the
latter we have nothing just now to do) will never fail to be justly
appreciated by the collector. I regret, Lisardo, for your own sake&mdash;as
you are about to collect a few choice books upon typography&mdash;that you
will have so much to pay for the former work, owing to its extreme
rarity in this country, and to the injudicious phrenzy of a certain
class of buyers, who are resolved to purchase it at almost any price.
Let me not forget to notice, with the encomiums which they deserve,
the useful and carefully compiled works of <span class="smcap">Seemiller</span>, <span class="smcap">Braun</span>,
<span class="smcap">Wurdtwein</span>, <span class="smcap">De Murr</span>, <span class="smcap">Rossi</span>, and <span class="smcap">Panzer</span>, whose busts are arranged in
progressive order. All these authors<a name="FNanchor_155_157" id="FNanchor_155_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_157" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> are greatly eminent in the
several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> departments which they occupy; especially Panzer&mdash;whose
<i>Annales Typographici</i>, in regard to arrangement and fulness of
information, leaves the similar work of his precedessor, Maittaire,
far behind. It is unluckily printed upon wretched paper&mdash;but who
rejects the pine-apple from the roughness of its coat? Get ready the
wherry; man it with a choice bibliomanical crew, good Lisardo!&mdash;and
smuggle over in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span> if you can, the precious works of these latter
bibliographers&mdash;for you may saunter "from rise to set of sun," from
Whitechapel to Hyde-Park Corner&mdash;for them&mdash;in vain!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_151_153" id="Footnote_151_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_151_153">[151]</a> Barthelemy, <span class="smcap">Mercier de St. Leger</span>, died in the
year 1800, and in the sixty-sixth of his age, full of
reputation, and deeply regretted by those who knew the
delightful qualities of his head and heart. It is not my
intention to enumerate <i>all</i> his publications, the titles of
which may be found in the <i>Siécles Littéraires</i>, vol. iv.,
p. 350: but, in the present place, I will only observe that
his "<i>Supplement à l'Histoire de l'Imprimerie, par P.
Marchand</i>," was first published in 1773, and afterwards in
1775, 4to., a rare and curious work; but little known in
this country. His <i>Bibliothéque des Romans, traduit de
Grec</i>, was published in 1796, 12 vols. 12mo. His letter
concerning De Bure's work, 1763, 8vo., betrayed some severe
animadversions upon the <i>Bibliogr. Instruct.</i>: but he got a
similar flagellation in return, from the Abbé Rive, in his
<i>Chasse aux Bibliographes</i>&mdash;who held him and De Bure, and
all the bibliographical tribe, in sovereign contempt. His
letter to Heinecken upon the rare editions of the 15th
century, 1783, 8vo., and his other works, I never saw in any
collection. The imperial library at Paris purchased his copy
of Du Verdier's and La Croix du Maine's Bibliothéques,
covered with his marginal annotations, as well as his copy
of Clement's <i>Bibl. Curieuse</i>. Le Blond, member of the
Institute, obtained his copy of De Bure's <i>Bibliographie
Instructive</i>, also enriched with MS. notes. Mr. Ochéda, Lord
Spencer's librarian, who knew well the Abbé de St. Leger,
informed me that he left behind him ample materials for a
History of Printing, in a new edition of his Supplement to
Marchand's work, which he projected publishing, and which
had received from him innumerable additions and corrections.
"He was a man," says Mr. Ochéda, "the most conversant with
editions of books of all kinds, and with every thing
connected with typography and bibliography, that I ever
conversed with." The reader may consult Peignot's <i>Dict. de
Bibliologie</i>, vol. i., p. 452, vol. iii., p. 212.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_152_154" id="Footnote_152_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_152_154">[152]</a> The <i>Onomasticon Literarium</i> of <span class="smcap">Christopher
Saxius</span>, <i>Traject. ad Rhenum</i>, 1775-90, seven vols. 8vo.,
with a supplement, or eighth volume, published in 1803, is
considered as a work of the very first reputation in its
way. The notices of eminent men are compendious, but
accurate; and the arrangement is at once lucid and new. An
elegantly bound copy of this scarce work cannot be obtained
for less than six and seven guineas. The first
bibliographical production of the Abbé <span class="smcap">Laire</span> was, I believe,
the <i>Specimen Historicum Typographiæ Romanæ, xv. seculi,
Romæ</i>, 1778, large 8vo.; of which work, a copy printed <span class="smcap">upon
vellum</span> (perhaps unique) was sold at the sale of M.
d'Hangard, in 1789, for 300 livres. <i>Dictionn. Bibliogr.</i>,
vol. iv., p. 250. In my Introduction, &amp;c., to the Greek and
Latin Classics, some account of its intrinsic merit will be
found: vol. i., p. xviii. In the year 1784 Laire published a
"<i>Dissertation sur l'origine et Progrès de l'Imprimerie en
Franche-Comté</i>," 8vo.; and, in the year 1791, came forth his
Catalogue Raisonné of the early printed books in the library
of Cardinal de Lomenie de Brienne; under the title of
"<i>Index Librorum ab Inventa Typographia, ad annum 1500</i>," in
two octavo volumes. See the article "<a href="#Lomenie"><span class="smcap">Lomenie</span></a>," in the list
of foreign catalogues, post. Laire was also the author of a
few other minor bibliographical productions. All the books
in his library, relating to this subject, were covered with
marginal notes; some of them very curious. See Peignot's
<i>Dict. de Bibliologie</i>, vol. i., p. 330: and <i>Les Siecles
Littéraires</i>, (1801, 8vo.) vol. iv., p. 75.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_153_155" id="Footnote_153_155"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153_155">[153]</a> The works and the merits of <span class="smcap">Audiffredi</span> have
been before submitted by me to the public; and Mr. Beloe, in
the third volume of his "<i>Anecdotes of Literature</i>," &amp;c.,
has justly observed upon the latter. In Lord Spencer's
magnificent library at Althorpe, I saw a copy of the
"<i>Editiones Italicæ</i>," sec. xv., 1793, 4to., upon <span class="smcap">large
paper</span>. It is much to be wished that some knowing
bibliographer upon the Continent would complete this
unfinished work of Audiffredi. His <i>Editiones Romanæ</i>, sec.
xv., 1783, 4to., is one of the most perfect works of
bibliography extant: yet Laire's "<i>Index Librorum</i>," &amp;c.
(see preceeding note), is necessary to supply the omission
of some early books printed at Rome, which had escaped even
this keen bibliographer!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_154_156" id="Footnote_154_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_154_156">[154]</a> <span class="smcap">Heinecken's</span> name stands deservedly high
(notwithstanding his tediousness and want of taste) among
bibliographical and typographical antiquaries. Of his
"<i>Nachrichten von Kunstlern und Kunst-Sachen</i>," Leipzig,
1768, 8vo., two vols., (being "New Memoirs upon Artists and
the objects of Art"&mdash;and which is frequently referred to by
foreigners,) I never saw a copy. It was again published in
1786. His "<i>Idée Générale d'une Collection complette
d'Estampes</i>," &amp;c., Leips., 1771, 8vo., is a most curious and
entertaining book; but unconscionably dear in this country.
His "<i>Dictionnaire des Artistes dont nous avons des
Estampes</i>," &amp;c., Leips. 1778, 8vo., four vols., is an
unfinished performance, but remarkably minute as far as it
goes. The remainder, written in the German language,
continues in MS. in the Electorate library at Dresden,
forming twelve volumes. Of the character of Heinecken's
latter work, consult Huber's <i>Manuel, &amp;c., des Amateurs de
l'Art</i>, Zurich, 1797, 8vo.: and a recent work entitled
"<i>Notices des Graveurs</i>," Paris, 1804, 8vo., two vols.
Heinecken died at the advanced age of eighty.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_155_157" id="Footnote_155_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_155_157">[155]</a> We will discuss their works <i>seriatim</i>, as
Lisardo has said above. <span class="smcap">Seemiller's</span> <i>Bibliothecæ
Incolstadiensis Incunabula Typographica</i>, contains four
parts, or fasciculi: they are bound in one volume, quarto,
1787, &amp;c.; but, unfortunately for those who love curious and
carefully executed works, it is rather rare in this country.
The <i>Notitia Historico-Critica de libris ab art typog.
invent.</i>, by <span class="smcap">Placid Braun</span>, in two parts, or volumes, 1788,
4to., with curious plates, has long been a desideratum in my
own collection; and my friend Mr. Beloe, who is luckily in
possession of a copy, enjoys his triumph over me when he
discovers it not in my bibliographical boudoir. The same
author also published his "<i>Notitia Historico-Literaria de
cod. MSS. in Bibl. Monast. ord. S. Bened. ad SS. Vidal. et
Afram Augustæ ex tantibus</i>," Aug. Vindel., 1791, 4to., two
vols. <i>Cat. de Santander</i>, vol. iv., p. 170. I know not how
any well versed bibliographer can do without the
"<i>Bibliotheca Moguntina libris sæculo primo
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Typographico">Tpyographico</span> Moguntiæ impressis
instructa</i>;" 1787, 4to., of <span class="smcap">Wurdtwein</span>. It has some curious
plates of fac-similes, and is rarely seen in the Strand or
King-street book-markets.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">C.T. De Murr</span> published a work
of some interest, entitled, "<i>Memorabilia Bibliothecarum
Publicarum Norimbergensium</i>," Norimb., 1786-91, three parts
or vols. 8vo.; which is also rare.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rossi's</span> valuable work
concerning the annals of Hebrew typography: <i>Annales
Hebræo-Typographici, à 1475, ad 1540</i>, Parmæ, 1795, 1799,
4to., two separate publications, is prettily printed by
Bodoni, and is an indispensable article in the collection of
the typographical antiquary. See the <i>Dict. de Bibliologie</i>,
vol. iii., p. 286.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Panzer's</span> <i>Annales Typographici</i>, in
eleven quarto volumes (1793-1803) is a work of the very
first importance to bibliographers. Its arrangement, after
the manner of Orlandi's, is clear and most convenient; and
the references to authorities, which are innumerable, are,
upon the whole, very faithful. The indexes are copious and
satisfactory. This work (of which I hear there are only
three copies upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>) contains an account of books
which were printed in all parts of Europe from the year
1457, to 1536, inclusive; but it should be remembered that
the author published a distinct work in the year 1788, 4to.,
relating to books which were printed, within the same
period, in the <i>German Language</i>; and this should always
accompany the eleven Latin volumes. I will just add from it,
as a curiosity, the title and colophon (translated into
English) of the first printed book in the German
language:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">The Publication of Diethers, Elector of Mayence,
against Count Adolphus of Nassau</span>; <i>given out under our
impressed seal on Tuesday, after the fourth Sunday in
Advent, anno Domini 1462</i>." Consult also Wurdtwein's <i>Bibl.
Mogunt.</i>, p. 80; and the authorities there referred to. It
seems doubtful whether this curious little brochure, of
which scarcely any thing more than a fragment now remains,
was printed by Fust and Schoeffer, or by Gutenberg.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_156_158" id="Footnote_156_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156_158">[156]</a> <span class="smcap">Michael Denis</span>, the translator of Ossian, and
a bibliographer of justly established eminence, was
principal librarian of the Imperial library at Vienna, and
died in the year 1800, at the age of 71. His <i>Supplement to
Maittaire's Typographical Annals</i>, in two parts or volumes,
1789, 4to., is a work of solid merit, and indispensable to
the possessor of its precursor. The bibliographical
references are very few; but the descriptions of the volumes
are minutely accurate. The indexes also are excellent. In
the year 1793, Denis published the first volume (in three
thick parts in folio) of his <i>Codices Manuscripti Theologici
Bibl. Palat. Vindob.</i>; a production which the reader will
find somewhat fully described in the ensuing pages. The
second volume appeared after his death in 1801. In 1795-6,
came forth his second edition of an <i>Introduction to the
Knowledge of Books</i>, in two quarto volumes; unfortunately
written in the German language&mdash;but mentioned with
approbation in the first volume of the <i>Mem. de l'Inst.</i>, p.
648. Consult also Peignot's <i>Dict. de Bibliologie</i>, vol. i.,
p. 122; ii., 232.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Armand Gaston Camus</span> is a bibliographer
of very first rate reputation. The reader has only to peruse
the following titles of some of his works, and he will
certainly bewail his ill fortune if they are not to be found
in his library. 1. <i>Observations sur la distribution et le
classement des livres d'une Bibliothéque</i>: 2. <i>Additions aux
mêmes</i>; 3. <i>Memoire sur un livre Allemand</i> (which is the
famous <span class="smcap">Tewrdannckhs</span>; and about which is to be hoped that Mr.
Douce will one day favour us with his curious remarks): 4.
<i>Addition au même</i>: 5. <i>Memoire sur l'histoire et les
procédés du Polytypage et de la Stéréotypie</i>: 6. <i>Rapport
sur la continuation de la Collection des Historiens de
France, et de celle des Chartres et Diplomes</i>: 7. <i>Notice
d'un livre imprimé à Bamberg en 1462</i>. All these works are
thus strung together, because they occur in the first three
volumes of the <i>Memoires de l'Institut</i>. This curious book,
printed at Bamberg, was discovered by a German clergyman of
the name of Stenier, and was first described by him in the
<i>Magasin Hist.-Litt., bibliogr.</i> Chemintz, 1792: but Camus's
memoir is replete with curious matter, and is illustrated
with fac-simile cuts. In the "<i>Notices et Extraits des MSS.
de la Bibl. Nationale</i>," vol. vi., p. 106, will be found a
most interesting memoir by him, relating to two ancient
manuscript bibles, in two volumes folio, adorned with a
profusion of pictures: of some of which very elegant
fac-similes are given. These pictures are 5152 in number!
each of them having a Latin and French verse beautifully
written and illuminated beneath.&mdash;Camus supposes that such a
work could not now be executed under 100,000 francs!&mdash;"Where
(exclaims he) shall we find such modern specimens of
book-luxury?" In the year 1802, he published an admirable
"<i>Mémoire sur la collection des grands et petits voyages, et
sur la Collection des Voyages des Melchesedech Thevenot</i>,"
4to., with an excellent "Table des Matières." Of his own
journey into the Low Countries, recently published, I never
met with a copy. All the preceding works, with the exception
of the last, are in my own humble collection.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_157_159" id="Footnote_157_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_157_159">[157]</a> A short bibliographical memoir of <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>
will be found in the first volume of my edition of the
<i>Typographical Antiquities of Great Britain</i>. Since that was
published, I have gleaned a few further particulars relating
to him, which may be acceptable to the reader. Shortly after
the appearance of his third volume, he thus speaks in a
letter to Mr. Price, librarian of the Bodleian library, "If
at any time you meet with any book of which I have not taken
notice, or made any mistake in the description of it, your
kind information will be esteemed a favour; as I purpose to
continue collecting materials for a future publication, when
enough shall be collected to make another volume." This was
in April, 1790. In the ensuing month he thus addresses his
old friend Mr. White, of Crickhowell, who, with himself, was
desperately addicted to the black-letter. "To morrow my wife
and self set out for Norfolk to take a little relaxation for
about a fortnight. I hope my labours will in some good
measure answer the expectation of my friends and subscribers
in general. Sure I am my best endeavours have been exerted
for that purpose. I have been 24 years collecting materials;
have spent many a fair pound, and many a weary hour; and it
is now ten years since the first part was committed to the
press. I purpose to continue collecting materials in order
to a fourth volume, &amp;c.;&mdash;yet by no means will I make myself
debtor to the public when to publish: if it shall please God
to take me to himself, Isaac will in due time set it forth.
However I shall keep an interleaved copy for the purpose."
In a letter to a Mr. John Banger Russell (in Dorsetshire),
written in the ensuing month of June, the same sentiments
and the same intention are avowed. Thus ardent was the
bibliomaniacal spirit of Herbert in his 72d year! The
<i>interleaved copy</i> here alluded to (which was bound in six
volumes 4to., in Russia binding, and for which Mr. Gough had
given Herbert's widow 52<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>) is now in my
possession; as well as the yet more valuable acquisition of
some numerous MS. addenda to his History of Printing&mdash;both
of these articles having been purchased by me at the sale of
Mr. Gough's MSS. and printed books, A.D. 1810.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_158_160" id="Footnote_158_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_158_160">[158]</a> Dr. <span class="smcap">Edward Harwood</span> published the fourth and
last edition of his "<i>View of the various editions of the
Greek and Roman Classics</i>," in the year 1790, 8vo. A work
which, in the public estimation, has entitled its author's
memory to very considerable respect in the classical world;
although the late Professor Porson, in the fly leaf of a
copy of my second edition of a similar publication, was
pleased to call the Doctor by a name rather unusually harsh
with <i>him</i>, who was "Criticus et lenis et acutus;" censuring
also my dependance upon my predecessor. In the year 1808,
was published my third edition of "<i>An introduction to the
knowledge of rare and valuable editions of the Greek and
Latin Classics</i>," two volumes 8vo.: in which, if I may
presume to talk of anything so insignificant, I have
endeavoured to exhibit the opinions&mdash;not of Dr. Harwood
alone, but of the most eminent foreign critics and
editors&mdash;upon the numerous editions which, in a
chronological series, are brought before the reader's
attention. The remarks of the first bibliographers in Europe
are also, for the first time in a English publication,
subjoined; so that the lover of curious, as well as of
valuable, editions may be equally gratified. The
authorities, exceedingly numerous as well as respectable,
are referred to in a manner the most unostentatious; and a
full measure of text, and to be really useful, was my design
from the beginning to the end of it. To write a long and
dull homily about its imperfections would be gross
affectation. An extensive sale has satisfied my publishers
that its merit a little counterbalances its defects.</p>

distinguished place amongst bibliographers, not only from
the care and attention with which he put forth the catalogue
of his own books&mdash;the parting from which must have gone near
to break his heart&mdash;but from his elegant and useful work
entitled, "<i>Dictionnaire Bibliographique choisi du quinzieme
Siécle</i>," 1805, &amp;c., 8vo., in three parts or volumes. His
summary of researches, upon the invention of printing, Mr.
Edwards told me, he read "with complete satisfaction"&mdash;this
occupies the first part or volume. The remaining volumes
form a necessary, as well as brilliant, supplement to De
Bure. Just at this moment, I believe that Mr. Beloe's, and
my own, copy of the work, are the only ones in this
country.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cailleau</span> has the credit of being author of the
<i>Dictionnaire Bibliographique</i>, &amp;c., in three volumes,
octavo, 1790&mdash;of which there are a sufficient number of
counterfeited and faulty re-impressions; but which, after
all, in its original shape, edit. 1790, is not free from
gross errors; however useful it is in many respects. I
suspect, however, that the Abbé <span class="smcap">Duclos</span> had the greater share
in this publication: but, be this as it may, the fourth
supplemental volume (by the younger Brunet) is, in every
respect, a more accurate and valuable performance. <span class="smcap">Oberlin</span>,
librarian of the central school or college at Strasbourg, is
author of a bibliographical treatise particularly deserving
of the antiquary's attention: namely, <i>Essai d'annales de la
vie de Jean</i> <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Gutenberg"><i>Gutenburg</i></span>, <i>&amp;c.</i>,
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Strasb.">Stasb.</span>, an. ix., 8vo. His
other numerous (belles-lettres) works are minutely specified
by Peignot in his <i>Dict. de Bibliologie</i>, vol. iii., p. 230.
His edition of Horace, Argent., 1788, 4to., is both elegant
and correct.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_160_162" id="Footnote_160_162"></a><a href="#FNanchor_160_162">[160]</a> Let us go quietly through the modern French
school of bibliography.&mdash;&mdash;Mons. <span class="smcap">Joseph Van-Praet</span> is
principal librarian of the Imperial collection at Paris, and
is justly called, by some of his fellow-labourers in the
same career, "one of the first bibliographers in Europe." He
is known to me, as a bibliographical writer, only by the
part which he took, and so ably executed, in the Valliere
catalogue of 1783. Peignot informs us that M. Van-Praet is
now busy in composing a little work&mdash;which I am sure will
rejoice the hearts of all true bibliomaniacs to be apprised
of&mdash;called a <i>Catalogue raisonné</i> of books <span class="smcap">printed upon
vellum</span>; for which he has already prepared not fewer than
2000 articles! See the <i>Curiosités Bibliogr.</i>, p. iij. Among
these <span class="smcap">vellum</span> articles, gentle reader, I assure thee that
thine eyes will be blest with the description of "<span class="smcap">The Shyp
of Fooles</span>," printed by Pynson, 1509! The urbanity and
politeness of this distinguished librarian are equal to his
knowledge.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gotthelf Fischer</span>, a Saxon by birth, and
librarian of the public collection at Mentz, has given us
the following interesting treatises, of which, I believe,
not five copies are to be found in this country:
namely&mdash;<i>Essai sur les Monumens Typographiques de Jean
Gutenberg, &amp;c.</i>, an. x. [1801], 4to.: and <i>Descriptions de
raretés typographiques et de Manuscrits remarquables, &amp;c.</i>,
Nuremb., 1801, 8vo.&mdash;the latter is in the German language,
and has cuts&mdash;with a portrait of Fust. By this time, the
work has most probably been translated into French, as it is
frequently referred to and highly spoken of by foreigners.
Peignot [<i>Dict. de Bibliologie</i>, vol. iii., p. 128] refers
us to the fine eulogy pronounced upon
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Fischer">Fisher</span> (not yet 40 years of age) by Camus, in his
"Voyage dans les departemens réunis," p. 12.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lambinet</span>
will always be remembered and respected, as long as printing
and bibliography shall be studied, by his "<i>Recherches
Historiques Littéraires et Critiques, sur l'Originè de
L'Imprimerie; particulièrement sur les premiers
établissemens au</i> XV<span class="super">me</span> <i>siécle dans la Belgique</i>," &amp;c.,
Brux., an. vii. (1798), 8vo. It is, indeed, a very
satisfactory performance: the result of judgment and
taste&mdash;rare union!&mdash;&mdash;In like manner, <span class="smcap">Renouard</span> has procured
for himself a bibliographical immortality by his <i>Annales de
l'Imprimerie des Aide</i>, 1803, 8vo., two vols.: a work almost
perfect of its kind, and by many degrees superior to
Bandini's dry <i>Annales Typog. Juntarum.</i>, Lucæ, 1761. In
Renouard's taste, accuracy and interest are delightfully
combined; and the work is printed with unrivalled beauty.
There were only six copies of it printed upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>;
one of which I saw in the fine collection of the Rt. Hon. T.
Grenville.&mdash;&mdash;Few modern bibliographers have displayed so
much diligence as <span class="smcap">Gabriel Peignot</span>: from whom we have, 1.
<i>Dictionnaire Raisonné de Bibliologie</i>, Paris, 1802, 8vo.,
two vols., with a third, by way of supplement (1804). With
necessary corrections and additions, this work would answer
many useful purposes in an English translation. 2. <i>Essai de
Curiosités Bibliographiques</i>, 1804, 8vo. This is a very
amusing (but scarce and unconscionably dear) book. It
contains elaborate descriptions of many curious and
sumptuous works, which were sold for 1000 and more livres at
public sales. 3. <i>Dictionnaire, &amp;c., des principaux livres
condamnés au feu, supprimés ou censurés</i>, Paris, 1806, 8vo.,
2 vols. The very title of such a work must sharpen the edge
of curiosity with those bibliomaniacs who have never seen
it. 4. <i>Bibliographie Curieuse, ou Notice Raisonnée des
livres imprimés a cent exemplaires au plus, suivie d'une
notice de quelques ouvrages tirés sur papier de couleur</i>,
Paris, 1808, 8vo. Only one hundred copies of this thin
volume were struck off: of which I possess the 86th copy,
according to Peignot's notification. Indeed I am fortunate
in having all his preceding works. Let us wish long life and
never-failing success to so brave a book-chevalier as
Gabriel Peignot.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">François Ignace Fournier</span>, at 18 years of
age, published an elegantly printed little volume, entitled
<i>Essai Portatif de Bibliographie</i>, 1796, 8vo., of which only
26 copies were struck off. In the year 1805, this essay
assumed the form of a Dictionary, and appeared under the
title of <i>Dictionnaire portatif de Bibliographie, &amp;c.</i>,
8vo., comprising 17,000 articles, printed in a very small
character. Last year, in the month of May, Fournier put
forth a new edition of this <i>Dictionnaire</i>, considerably
augmented; but in which (such is the fate of bibliographical
studies) notwithstanding all the care of the author, Brunet
tells us that he has discovered not fewer than five hundred
errors! Let not Fournier, however be discouraged; in a few
years he will achieve something yet more worthy of his
laudable seal in bibliography.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Antoine-Alexandre Barbier</span>,
librarian of the Council of State, has favoured us with an
admirably well executed work, entitled <i>Dictionnaire des
Ouvrages Anonymes et Pseudonymes, composés, traduits ou
publiés en Français, &amp;c., accompagneé de notes historiques
et critiques</i>, Paris, <i>Imprimis Bibliogr.</i>, 1806, 8vo., two
vols. See also art. "<a href="#Conseil">Conseil d'Etat</a>," in the list of French
Catalogues, post. From these the reader will judge of the
warm thanks to which this eminent bibliographer is entitled
for his very useful labours.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. Boucher</span> de la Richarderie
has, in an especial manner, distinguished himself by his
<i>Bibliothéque Universelle des Voyages</i>, Paris, 1808, 8vo.,
six vols.: a work executed with care, minuteness, and
considerable interest. Some of its extracts are, perhaps,
unnecessarily long. The index to the sixth volume will lead
the reader to consult an account of some of the most
ancient, rare, and curious publications of voyages which
have ever appeared: and Boucher "has deserved well" of the
book world by this truly valuable and almost indispensable
performance.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brunet</span> Le Fils. This able writer, and
enthusiastic devotee to bibliography, has recently published
an excellent and copious work which would appear greatly to
eclipse Fournier's; entitled "<i>Manuel du Libraire et de
l'Amateur de Livres, contenant, 1. Un Nouveau Dictionnaire
Bibliographigue, 2. Une Table en forme de Catalogue
Raisonnée</i>," Paris, 1810, 8vo., 3 vols.: in which he tells us
he has devoted at least thirty years to the examination of
books. The first two volumes form a scientific arrangement:
the latter is an alphabetical one, referring to one or the
other of the preceding volumes for a more copious account of
the work. It must be confessed that Brunet has, in this
publication, executed a difficult task with great ability.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I am quite anxious to possess the publications of these moderns:
but you say nothing of their comparative value with the ancients.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Generally speaking, in regard to discoveries of rare books and
typographical curiosities, the moderns have the advantage. They have
made more rational conclusions, from data which had escaped their
predecessors: and the sparkling and animated manner in which they
dress out the particular objects that they describe renders the
perusal of their works more pleasant and gratifying. I am not sure
that they have the learning of the old school: but their works are, in
general, less ponderous and repulsive. The ancient bibliographers were
probably too anxious to describe every thing, however minute and
unimportant: they thought it better to say too much than too little;
and, finding the great mass of readers in former times, uninstructed
in these particular pursuits, they thought they could never exhaust a
subject by bringing to bear upon it every point, however remotely
connected! They found the plain, it is true, parched and sandy; but
they were not satisfied with pouring water upon it, 'till they had
converted it into a deluge.<a name="FNanchor_161_163" id="FNanchor_161_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_163" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_161_163" id="Footnote_161_163"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161_163">[161]</a> What Denis says, in the preface to his
<i>Catalog. Cod. MSS. Bibl. Palat. Vindob.</i> (of which see <a href="#Page_65">p.
65</a>, ante) is very just; "media incedendum via; neque nudis
codicum titulis, ut quibusdam bibliothecis placuit, in
chartam conjectis provehi multum studia, neque <i>doctis, quæ
superioris seculi fuit intemperantia, ambagibus et
excursibus</i>."&mdash;This is certainly descriptive of the <span class="smcap">old
school</span> of bibliography.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Let me ask you, at this stage of our inquiries, what you mean by
bibliographical publications?&mdash;and whether the works of those authors
which you have enumerated are sufficient to enable a novice, like
myself, to have pretty accurate notions about the rarity and intrinsic
value of certain works?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> By bibliographical publications, I mean such works as give us
some knowledge of the literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span> productions, as well as of the life,
of certain learned men; which state the various and the best editions
of their lucubrations; and which stimulate us to get possession of
these editions. Every biographical narrative which is enriched with
the mention of curious and rare editions of certain works is, to a
great extent, a bibliographical publication. Those works which treat
professedly upon books are, of course, immediately within the pale of
bibliography.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> But am I to be satisfied with the possession of those works
already recommended?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> I suppose Lisardo has heard of certain valuable <span class="smcap">catalogues</span>, and
he wishes to know how far the possession of these may be requisite in
order to make him a bibliographer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> At present I will say nothing about the catalogues of the
collections of our own countrymen. As we have been travelling
principally abroad, we may direct our attention to those which relate
to foreign collections.</p>

<p class="bp">And first, let us pay a due tribute of praise to the published
Catalogues of Libraries collected by the <span class="smcap">Jesuits</span>: men of shrewd
talents and unabating research, and in derogation of whose merits
Voltaire and D'Alembert disgraced themselves by scribbling the most
contemptible lampoons. The downfall of this society led, not very
indirectly, to the destruction of the ancient French monarchy. Men
seemed to forget that while the most shameless depredations were
committed within the libraries of the Jesuits, the cause of learning,
as well as of liberty, suffered,&mdash;and the spoils which have glittered
before our eyes, as the precious relics of these collections, serve to
afford a melancholy proof how little those men stick at any thing who,
in raising the war-whoop of liberty and equality, tear open the very
bowels of order, tranquillity, peace, and decorum! But, to the
subject. Let the catalogues of <span class="smcap">public collections</span>, when they are well
arranged, be received into your library. Of foreign <span class="smcap">private

serve me, will enable you to form a pretty correct estimate of the
<i>market<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>able value</i> of certain rare and sumptuous publications.
Catalogues are, to bibliographers, what <i>Reports</i> are to lawyers: not
to be read through from beginning to end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>&mdash;but to be consulted on
doubtful points, and in litigated cases. Nor must you, after all,
place too strong a reliance upon the present prices of books, from
what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span> have produced at former sales; as nothing is more
capricious and unsettled than the value of books at a public auction.
But, in regard to these catalogues, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> you should be fortunate enough
to possess any which are printed upon <i>Large Paper, with the Names of
the Purchasers, and the Prices</i> for which each set of books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> was sold,
thrice and four times happy may you account yourself to be, my good
Lisardo!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_162_164" id="Footnote_162_164"></a><a href="#FNanchor_162_164">[162]</a> As it would have required more breath than
usually falls to the lot of an individual, for Lysander to
have given even a rough sketch of the merits, demerits, and
rarity of certain foreign catalogues of public and private
collections&mdash;in his discourse with his friends&mdash;I have
ventured to supply the deficiency by subjoining, in the
ensuing <i>tolerably copious</i> note, a list of these
catalogues, alphabetically arranged; as being, perhaps, the
most convenient and acceptable plan. Such an attempt is
quite novel; and must be received, therefore, with many
grains of allowance. Although I am in possession of the
greater number (at least of two thirds) of the catalogues
described, I am aware that, in regard to the description of
those not in my own library, I subject myself to the lash of
P. Morhof. "Inepti sunt, qui librorum catalogos scribunt e
catalogis. Oculata fides et judicium præsens requiritur."
<i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>, vol. i., 230. But the weight of my
authorities will, I trust, secure me from any great violence
of critical indignation. To render so dry a subject (the
very "<i>Hortus Siccus</i>" of bibliography) somewhat palatable,
I have here and there besprinkled it with biographical
anecdotes of the collectors, and of the state of French
literature in the last century and a half.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">D'Aguesseau.</span>
<i>Catalogue des Livres Imprimés et Manuscrits de la
Bibliothéque de feu Monsieur D'Aguesseau</i>, &amp;c., Paris, 1785,
8vo. "Anxious to enrich his collection, (says the compiler
of this catalogue) the Bibliomaniac sees with delight the
moment arrive when, by the sale of a library like this, he
may add to his precious stores. It is, in truth, a grand
collection; especially of history, arts, and sciences, and
jurisprudence. The famous Chancellor D'Aguesseau laid the
foundation of this library, which was as universal as his
own genius." It would appear that the son, to whom the
collection latterly belonged, was gracious in the extreme in
the loan of books; and that, in consequence, a public
advertisement was inserted at the foot of the "Avis
preliminaire," to entreat those, who had profited by such
kindness, to return their borrowed (shall I say stolen?)
goods? For want of these volumes, many sets of books were
miserably defective.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Anonymiana.</span> <i>Catalogus Bibliothecæ
Anonymianæ, in quo libri rariores recensentur, una cum notis
litterariis</i>, Norimb., 1738, 8vo. This is a catalogue of
value, and may be well ranged with its brethren upon the
bibliographer's shelf. Another "<i>Bibliotheca Anonymiana</i>,"
was published ten years preceding the present one; at the
Hague, in three parts, one vol., 8vo.: which, in the <i>Bibl.
Solger.</i>, vol iii., n<span class="super">o</span>. 1388, is said to contain many
rare books: see also n<span class="super">o</span>. 1370, <i>ibid.</i>&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">D'Artois.</span>
<i>Catalogue des Livres du Cabinet de Monseigneur Le Compte
D'Artois</i>, Paris, 1783, 8vo. Very few copies of this
catalogue, which is printed in a wide octavo page,
resembling that of a quarto, were struck off: according to
Fournier's <i>Dict. Portat. de Bibliogr.</i>, p. 120, edit. 1809.
See also <i>Cat. de Boutourlin</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 3876.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustana.</span>
<i>Catalogus Bibliothecæ inclytæ Reipubl. Augustanæ utriusque
linguæ tum Græcæ tum Latinæ librorum et impressorum et manu
exaratorum.</i> Aug. Vindel., 1600, fol. Morhof informs us that
this catalogue, of which Hoeschelius was the compiler,
contains an account of some manuscripts which have never
been printed, as well as of some which Marcus Velserus
published. It is, moreover, full of precious bibliographical
matter; but unfortunately (the possessor of it may think
otherwise) only <span class="smcap">one hundred copies</span> were struck off.
<i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>, vol. i., 211. I find, however, some
little difficulty about distinguishing this catalogue of the
Augsbourg library from the impression of 1633, fol., which
Vogt mentions at p. 323, and of which he also talks of 100
copies being printed. It should not be forgotten that
Hoeschelius published an admirable catalogue of the Greek
MSS. in the library of Augsbourg, 1595, and again 1605, in
4to. Colomiés pronounces it a model in its way. <i>Bibl.
Choisie</i>, p. 194-5. The catalogue of the Greek MSS. in the
library of the Duke of Bavaria, at Munich, was published
about the same period; namely, in 1602: the compiler was a
skilful man, but he tells us, at the head of the catalogue,
that the MSS. were open to the inspection of every one who
had any work in hand, provided he were a <i>Roman Catholic</i>!
This was being very kind to protestants! <i>Jugemens des
Savans</i>, vol. ii., part i., p. 215, edit. 1725. See also
Vogt's <i>Catalog. Libror. Rarior.</i>, p. 232.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Augustana.</span>
<i>Notitia historica-literaria de libris ab artis typographicæ
inventione usque ad annum, 1478, impressis, in Bibliotheca

August, Vindel, 1788, 4to. This volume, which I have no
doubt would gratify the curious bibliographer, it has never
been my good fortune to meet with. It is here introduced
upon the authority of the <i>Cat. du Cardinal de Loménie</i>,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 2647: ed. 1797. I ought not to close this account of
the Augsbourg catalogues of books, without remarking, on the
authority of Reimannus, that the <i>first</i> published catalogue
of books is that which Villerius, a bookseller at Augsburg,
put forth in the year 1564. See the <i>Bibl. Acroam.</i>, p.
5.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Aurivillius.</span> <i>Catalogus Bibliothecæ quam collegerat

i. and ii., Upsal, 1787, 8vo. This catalogue contains a
plentiful sprinkling of short literary and bibliographical

bibliographical notes which are here and there scattered
throughout this catalogue, render it of estimation in the
opinion of the curious.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Baluze.</span> <i>Bibliotheca Balusiana;
seu catalogus librorum bibliothecæ D.S. Baluzii, A. Gab.
Martin</i>, Paris, 1719, 8vo., two vols. Let any enlightened
bibliographers read the eulogy upon the venerable Baluze
(who died in his eighty-eighth year, and who was the great
Colbert's librarian), in the preface of the <i>Bibl.
Colbertina</i> (vide <a href="#Colbert">post</a>), and in the <i>Dict. Hist.</i> (Caen,
1789, vol. i., p. 443-4), and he will not hesitate a moment
about the propriety of giving this volume a conspicuous
place upon his shelf. From the <i>Bibl. Mencken</i>, p. 10, it
would appear that a third volume, containing translations of
some MSS. in the royal library, is wanting to make this
catalogue complete. This third volume is
uncommon.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Barberini.</span> <i>Index Bibliothecæ Francisci
Barberini Cardinalis. Romæ, Typis Barberinis</i>, 1681, fol.,
three vols. in two. The widely spread celebrity of Cardinal
Barberini suffers no diminution from this publication of the
riches contained within his library. The authors are
arranged alphabetically, and not according to classes.
Although it be not the most luminous in its arrangement, or
the most accurate in its execution, this finely printed
catalogue will never remain long upon a bookseller's shelf
without a purchaser. It were much to be desired that our own
noblemen, who have fine collections of books, would put
forth (after the example of Cardinal Barberini) similar
publications.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Barthelemy.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres de la
Bibliothéque de M. l'Abbé Barthelemy, par M. Bernard</i>, 1800,

will always secure purchasers for this catalogue of useful
and interesting books.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bibliographie</span> <i>des Pays Bas, avec
quelques notes. Nyon, en Suisse</i>, 1783, 4to. Only fifty
copies of this work were printed. It is a pity that Peignot,
who gives us this information, does not accompany it with
some account of the nature and merits of the work&mdash;which
probably grew out of the <i>Histoire Littéraire des Pays
Blas</i>, 1725, in three folio volumes. <i>Bibl. Curieuse</i>, p.
10.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bodleian.</span> <i>Catalog. Libr. Bibl. Publ., &amp;c., in Acad.
Oxon.</i>, 1605, 4to. <i>Catal. Libr. Impr.</i>, 1674, fol.
<i>Catalogi Libror. MSS. Angl. et Hibern.</i>, 1697, fol.
<i>Catalogus Impress. Libror. Bibl. Bodl.</i>, 1733, fol., two
vols. Although none but catalogues of foreign public and
private collections were intended to be noticed in this
list, the reader will forgive a little violation of the rule
laid down by myself, if I briefly observe upon the
catalogues of the Bodleian library and the British Museum.
[For the latter, vide '<a href="#Museum"><span class="smcap">Museum</span></a>.'] The first of these Bodleian
catalogues contains an account of the MSS. It was prepared
by Dr. James, the editor of the Philobiblion of De Bury
(vide <a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a>, ante), and, as it was the first attempt to
reduce to "lucid order" the indigested pile of MSS.
contained in the library, its imperfections must be
forgiven. It was afterwards improved, as well as enlarged,
in the folio edition of 1697, by Bernard; which contains the
MSS. subsequently bequeathed to the library by Selden,
Digby, and Laud, alone forming an extensive and valuable
collection. The editor of Morhof (vol. i., 193, n.) has
highly commended this latter catalogue. Let the purchaser of
it look well to the frontispiece of the portraits of Sir
Thomas Bodley and of the fore-mentioned worthies, which
faces the title-page; as it is frequently made the prey of
some prowling Grangerite. The first catalogue of the
<i>Printed Books</i> in the Bodleian library was compiled by the
celebrated orientalist, Dr. Hyde: the second by Fisher: of
these, the latter is the more valuable, as it is the more
enlarged. The plan adopted in both is the same: namely, the
books are arranged alphabetically, without any reference to
their classes&mdash;a plan fundamentally erroneous: for the chief
object in catalogues of public collections is to know what
works are published upon particular subjects, for the
facility of information thereupon&mdash;whether our inquiries
lead to publication or otherwise: an alphabetical index
should, of course, close the whole. It is with reluctance my
zeal for literature compels me to add that a <i>Catalogue
Raisonnée of the Manuscripts and Printed Books in the
Bodleian Library</i> is an urgent desideratum&mdash;acknowledged by
every sensible and affectionate son of <span class="smcap">Alma Mater</span>. Talent
there is, in abundance, towards the completion of such an
honourable task; and the only way to bring it effectually
into exercise is to employ heads and hands enough upon the
undertaking. Let it be remembered what Wanley and Messrs.
Planta and Nares have done for the Cottonian and Harleian
MSS.&mdash;and what Mr. Douce is now doing for those of the
Lansdowne collection! One gentleman alone, of a very
distinguished college, in whom the acuteness and solidity of
Porson seem almost revived, might do wonders for the Greek
MSS., and lend an effectual aid towards the arrangement of
the others. The printed books might be assigned, according
to their several classes, to the gentlemen most conversant
with the same; and the numerous bibliographical works,
published since the catalogue of 1733, might be occasionally
referred to, according to the plan observed in the <i>Notitia
Editionum vel Primariæ, &amp;c., in Bibl. Bodl. Oxon.</i>, 1795,
8vo.; which was judiciously drawn up by the Bishop of
London, and the Rev. Dr. William Jackson. I am aware that
the aged hands of the present venerable librarian of the
Bodleian library can do little more than lay the
foundation-stone of such a massive superstructure; but even
this would be sufficient to enrol his name with the
Magliabecchis and Baillets of former times&mdash;to entitle him
to be classed among the best benefactors to the library&mdash;and
to shake hands with its immortal founder, in that place
where are</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnier.</span> <i>Catalogue des livres de la Bibliothéque de
Bonnier.</i> Paris, 1800, 8vo. This catalogue is here
introduced to the bibliographer's notice in order to sharpen
his bibliomaniacal appetite to obtain one of the four copies
only which were printed upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span> of Dutch
manufacture. See <i>Cat. de Caillard</i> (1808), n<span class="super">o</span>.
2596.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Boutourlin.</span> <i>Catalogue des livres de la
Bibliothéque de S.E.M. Le Comte de Boutourlin.</i> Paris (an.
xiii.), 1805, 8vo. Every one must conceive a high respect
for the owner of this choice collection, from the amiable
sentiments which pervade the preface to the catalogue. It
has a good index; and is elegantly printed. My copy is upon
<span class="smcap">large paper</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">De Boze.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres du Cabinet de
M. Claude Gros de Boze.</i> Paris. <i>De l'Imp. Royale</i>, 1745,
small folio. This is the first printed catalogue of the
choice and magnificent library of De Boze, the friend and
correspondent of Dr. Mead, between whom presents of books
were continually passing&mdash;as they were the first collectors
of the day in their respective countries. Some have said 50,
some 35, others 25, and others <span class="smcap">only 12 copies</span> of this
impression were struck off, as presents for the collector's
friends. Consult <i>Bibl. Mead</i>, p. 81, n<span class="super">o</span>. 617. <i>Bibl.
Creven.</i>, vol. v., 291. <i>Bauer's Bibl. Rarior.</i>, vol. i.,
151. <i>Bibl. Curieuse</i>, p. 12. <i>Bibl. Askev.</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 508.
Barbier's <i>Dict. des Anonymes</i>, vol. ii., n<span class="super">o</span>. 8002.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">De
Boze</span>, <i>de la même bibliothéque</i>, 1753, 8vo. This catalogue,
which was executed by Martin, after the death of De Boze,
does not contain all the notices of works mentioned in the
preceding one. It is, however, well deserving of a place in
the bibliographer's library. Peignot tells us that there was
yet a <i>third</i> catalogue printed, in 8vo., containing 192
pages, and giving an account of some books taken out of De
Boze's collection: a few of which are described in the
preceding edition of 1753. See his <i>Bibl. Cur.</i>, p.
12.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bozerian.</span> <i>Notice des livres précieux</i>
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: de"><i>ye</i></span> <i>M. Bozérian, par M. Bailly</i>, 1798,
8vo. A cabinet of "precious books," indeed! The misfortune
is, so small a number of modern foreign catalogues come over
here that the best of them will be found in few of our
libraries. Whenever the "Bibliotheca Bozeriana" shall be
imported, it will not stop seven days upon a bookseller's
shelf!&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bulteau.</span> <i>Bibliotheca Bultelliana; (Caroli
Bulteau) a Gabr. Martin</i>, Paris, 1711, 12mo., 2 vols. in
one. This catalogue, which is carefully compiled, contains
curious and uncommon books; many of which were purchased for
the collections of Préfond, De Boze, and others.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bunau.</span>
<i>Catalogus Bibliothecæ Bunavianæ.</i> Lipsiæ, 1750. Six parts,
in three volumes, each volume having two parts&mdash;usually
bound in six vols. Highly and generally esteemed as is this
extensive collection, and methodically arranged catalogue,
of Count Bunau's books, the latter has always appeared to me
as being branched out into too numerous ramifications, so as
to render the discovery of a work, under its particular
class, somewhat difficult, without reference to the index. I
am aware that what Camus says is very true&mdash;namely, that
"nothing is more absurd than to quarrel about
catalogue-making: and that every man ought to have certain
fixed and decisive ideas upon the subject," [<i>Mem. de
l'Inst.</i> vol. i., 650,] but simplicity and perspicuity,
which are the grand objects in every undertaking, might have
been, in my humble apprehension, more successfully exhibited
than in this voluminous catalogue. It represents <i>over-done
analysis</i>! yet those who are writing upon particular
subjects will find great assistance in turning to the
different works here specified upon the same. It is rare and
high-priced. From the preface, which is well worth an
attentive perusal, it appears that this grand collection,
now deposited in the electoral library at Dresden (see <i>Cat.
de Caillard</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 2545, 1808,) was at Count Bunau's
country-house, situated in a pleasant village about half a
mile from  Dresden&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Vicinam videt unde lector urbem.</p>

<p>Saxius, in his <i>Onomast. Literar.</i>, vol i., p. xxxiii.,

collection.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bunneman.</span> <i>J.L. Bunnemanni Catalogus
Manuscriptorum, item librorum impressorum rarissimorum pro
assignato pretio venalium.</i> Minda, 1732, 8vo. For the sake
of knowing, by way of curiosity, what books (accounted rare
at this period) were sold for, the collector may put this
volume into his pocket, when he finds it upon a book-stall
marked at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> In the <i>Bibl. Solger.</i>, vol iii.,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 1396, there was a priced copy upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span> with
bibliographical memoranda.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Caillard.</span> <i>Catalogue des
livres du Cabinet de M.A.B. Caillard</i>, Paris, 1805, 8vo. Of
this private catalogue, compiled by Caillard himself, and
printed upon fine Dutch paper, in super-royal 8vo., only
twenty-five copies were struck off. So says Fournier, <i>Dict.
Portatif de Bibliographie</i>: p. 120; edit. 1809, and the
"avant-propos" prefixed to the subsequent catalogue here
following:&mdash;&mdash;<i>Livres rares et précieux de la Bibliothéque
de feu M. Ant. Bern. Caillard</i>, Paris, 1808, 8vo. There were
but twenty-five copies of this catalogue of truly valuable,
and, in many respects, rare, and precious, books, printed
upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, of the same size as the preceding. This
was the sale catalogue of the library of Caillard, who died
in 1807, in his sixty-ninth year, and of whose
bibliomaniacal spirit we have a most unequivocal proof in
his purchasing De Cotte's celebrated uncut copy of the first
printed Homer, at an enormous sum! [vide <a href="#Cotte"><span class="smcap">Cotte</span></a>, post.] "Sa
riche bibliothéque est á-la-fois un monument de son amour
pour l'art typographique, et de la vaste étendue de ses
connoissances," p. xiv. Some excellent indexes close this
volume; of which Mr. Payne furnished me with the loan of his
copy upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cambis.</span> <i>Catalogue des principaux
manuscrits du cabinet de M. Jos. L.D. de Cambis</i>, Avignon,
1770, 4to. Although this is a catalogue of MSS., yet, the
number of copies printed being very few, I have given it a
place here. Some of these copies contain but 519, others
766, pages; which shews that the owner of the MSS. continued
publishing his account of them as they increased upon him.
Rive, in his "<i>Chasse aux bibliographes</i>," has dealt very
roughly with the worthy Cambis; but Peignot tells us that
this latter was a respectable literary character, and a
well-informed bibliographer&mdash;and that his catalogue, in
spite of Rive's diatribe, is much sought after. See the
<i>Bibliogr. Curieuse</i>, p. 14; also <i>Cat. de la Valliere</i>,

maroquin, de la bibliothéque du même, Paris, an trois</i>
(1795), 8vo. Of the <i>first</i> catalogue only a small number of
copies was printed, and those for presents. <i>Bibliogr.
Curieuse</i>, p. 15. It contains a description of De Boze's
extraordinary copy of Du Fresnoy's "Methode pour étudier
l'Histoire," 1729, 4to., four volumes, with the supplement,
1740, two vols.; which was sold for 1500 livres; and which
was, of course, upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, with a thousand inviting
additions, being much more complete than the similar copies
in <i>Cat. de Valliere</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 4467; and <i>Cat. de Crevenna</i>,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 5694, edit. 1789; although this latter was preferable
to the Valliere copy. Consult also the <i>Curiosités
Bibliographiques</i>, p. 77-8. The <i>second</i> catalogue was
prepared by De Bure, and contains a very fine collection of
natural history, which was sold at the Hôtel de Bullion. The
printed prices are added. The <i>third</i> catalogue, which was
prepared by Santus, after the decease of Camus, contains
some very choice articles [many printed <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>] of
ancient and modern books superbly bound.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Catalogue</span> <i>des

collection was formed from a great number of sales of
magnificent libraries, and that particular circumstances
induced the owner to part with it. The books were in the
finest order, and bound by the most skilful binders. The
bibliographical notices are short, but judicious; and a good

abridged Vogt's excellent account of this very uncommon and
precious catalogue, of which <span class="smcap">only twenty-five copies</span> were
printed, has forgotten to examine the last edition of the
<i>Catalog. Libror. Rarior.</i>, pp. 262-3; in which we find that
the collection contained 248 (and not 217) volumes. At the
end, it is said: "Pretiosissima hæc Librorum Collectio,

excellent catalogue of the Oriental MSS. in the
Medico-Laurentian library; but this work of the father is
more curious and elaborate. Whenever a few half-guineas can
procure it, let the country-settled philologist send his

three vols. The preface to this valuable catalogue (executed
by Martin) gives us a compressed, but sufficiently
perspicuous, account of the auspices under which such an
extensive and magnificent collection was assembled and
arranged. It contains not fewer than 18,219 articles; being
perhaps 60,000 volumes. The celebrated Baluze was the
librarian during the life of the former branches of the
Colbert family; a family which, if nothing remained to
perpetuate their fame but this costly monument of literary
enterprise, will live in the grateful remembrance of
posterity&mdash;but it wants not even such a splendid memorial!

order of its arrangement, and the skilful researches
exhibited in it relating to anonymous authors, are worthy of
the typographical luxury of the national press, from which
this curious work was put forth. It will be perfect in three
parts: the third part, containing the supplement and tables,
is now at press." (A.D. 1804.) The preface and table of the
divisions of this catalogue were published in a small 8vo.
volume, 1801. This information I glean from Peignot's
<i>Curiosités Bibliographiques</i>, p. lix.; and from the <i>Cat.

which the French government took upon itself the

cum indice titulorum</i>, Parisiis, 1643, 4to. The celebrated
Naudé had the drawing up and publishing of this catalogue,
which is highly coveted by collectors, and is now of rare
occurrence. De Cordes was intimate with all the learned men
of his country and age; and his eulogy, by Naudé, prefixed
to the catalogue, gives us a delightful account of an
amiable and learned man living in the bosom, as it were, of
books and of book-society. This collection, which was
purchased by Cardinal Mazarin, formed the foundation of the
latter's magnificent library. Consult the <i>Jugemens des
Savans</i>, vol. ii., p. 142; Colomié's <i>Biblioth. Choisie</i>, p.
126; <i>Mem. de l'Inst.</i>, vol. i., p. 647. Nor must we forget
Morhof&mdash;<i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>, vol. i., p. 211; who, after a
general commendation of the collection, tells us it is
remarkable for containing a fine body of foreign history. De
Cordes died A.D. 1642, in the 72d year of his age&mdash;nearly 50
years having been devoted by him to the formation of his
library. "Fortunate senex!"&mdash;&mdash;<a name="Cotte" id="Cotte"></a><span class="smcap">Cotte.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres

most exorbitant sums: "the wealthy amateurs striving to make
themselves masters of the <span class="smcap">large paper</span> Alduses, Elzevirs, and

1789, 8vo., five vols.&mdash;<i>De la même collection</i>, 1793, 8vo.
Of these catalogues of one of the most extensive and
magnificent collections ever formed in Amsterdam, the first
impression of 1776 (to which I have generally referred) is
by far the most valuable in regard to bibliographical
remarks and copious description. Peignot tells us that no
bibliographer can do without it. It was commenced in the
year 1774, and published during the life time of Peter
Antony Crevenna, the father; from whom the collection passed
into the hands of the son Bolongari Crevenna, and in whose
lifetime it was sold by public auction. The second
impression of 1789 is the sale-catalogue, and contains more
books than the preceding one; but the bibliographical
observations are comparatively trifling. There are copies of
this latter impression upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span> in quarto. I possess
an interesting copy of the small paper, which has numerous
marginal remarks in pencil, by Mr. Edwards; who examined the
library at Amsterdam, with a view to purchase it entire. The
last catalogue of 1793, which was published after the death
of the son, contains a few choice books which he had
reserved for himself, and, among them, a curious set of
fac-simile drawings of old prints and title-pages; some of
which were obtained at the sale of the elder Mirabeau (vide
<a href="#Mirabeau">post</a>). It seems to have been the ruling passion of B.
Crevenna's life to collect all the materials, from all
quarters, which had any connection, more or less, with "<span class="smcap">the
origin and progress of printing</span>," and it is for ever to be
regretted that such extensive materials as those which he
had amassed, and which were sold at the sale of 1793 should
have been dissipated beyond the hope of restoration. See
Peignot's <i>Dict. de Bibliologie</i>, vol. iii., p. 100; and his
<i>Curiosités Bibliographiques</i>, p. 139.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Crozat.</span> <i>Catalogue
des Livres de Monsieur Le President Crozat de Tugny</i>, Paris,
1751, 8vo. This collection was particularly rich in the
belles-lettres&mdash;and especially in Italian and French
Romance-Literature.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Van Damme.</span> <i>Catalogue d'une
Bibliotheque, vendue publiquement à la Haye, le 8 Octobre,
par Varon et Gaillard</i>, 1764, three vols. 8vo. "This
precious and rare collection belonged to M. Pierre Van
Damme, book-merchant at Amsterdam, equally well known for
his knowledge of bibliography and of medals; of which latter
he had a beautiful and uncommon collection." <i>Bibl.

Duboisiana, ou Catalogue de la Bibliothéque du Cardinal

which evinces the fine taste and sound judgment of the
Cardinal Du Bois. It is not rare abroad.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Elzevir.</span>
<i>Catalogus librorum qui in Bibliopolio Officinæ Danielis
Elzevirii venales extant</i>, Ams. 1674, 12mo.: 1681,
12mo.&mdash;<i>qui in Bibliopoli Elzeviriano venales extant</i>, Lug.
Bat., 1634, 1684, 4to. These, and other catalogues of the
books printed by the distinguished family of the Elzevirs,
should find a place within the cabinet of bibliographers.
The first book ever published by the Elzevirs was of the
date of 1595; the last, of 1680 or 1681, by Daniel Elzevir,
who was the only surviving branch. His widow carried on the
business after his decease in 1680. In the <i>Dictionnaire de
Bibliologie</i> of Peignot, vol. i., p. 216, vol. iii., p. 116,
will be found a pleasing account of this family of (almost)
unrivalled printers.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Du Fay.</span> <i>Bibliotheca Fayana seu
Catalogus librorum Bibl. Cor. Hier. de Cisternay du Fay,
digestus à Gabriel Martin</i>, Paris, 1725, 8vo. The catalogue
of this collection, which is a judicious one, and frequently
referred to, is very carefully put forth by Martin. I think
that I have seen a copy of it upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fagel.</span>
<i>Bibliotheca Fageliana. A catalogue of the valuable and
extensive Library of the Greffier Fagal, of the Hague: in
two parts.</i> London, 1802, 8vo. It is highly creditable to
that most respectable establishment, Trinity College,
Dublin, that the present grand collection of books was
purchased "en masse" (for 7000<i>l.</i>) to be deposited within
its library; thus rendering the interior of the latter
"companion meet" for its magnificent exterior. The
title-page of the first part announces the sale of the books
by auction by Mr. Christie; but the above offer having been
made for the whole collection, the same was forthwith
transported to Ireland. Collectors should take care that the
second part of this catalogue be not wanting, which is
oftentimes the case. A good index only is requisite to make
the <span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Fageliana</span> rank with the most valuable
publications of its kind in existence. It was compiled by
the well-known S. Paterson.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Faultrier.</span> <i>Catalogus
Librorum Bibliothecæ Domini Joachimi Faultrier, digestus à
Prosper Marchand</i>, Paris, 1709, 8vo. The bibliographical
introductory remarks, by Marchand, render this volume (which
rarely occurs) very acceptable to collectors of catalogues.
Maittaire has spoken well of the performance, <i>Annal.
Typog.</i> iii., p. 482. Consult also the <i>Mem. de l'Inst.</i>,
vol. i., p. 675, and the <i>Dict. de Bibliologie</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 235, upon Marchand's introductory remarks relating to the
arrangement of a library.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Favier.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres
de la Bibliothéque de feu Mons. L'Abbé Favier, Prêtre à
Lille</i>, Lille, 1765, 8vo. A well arranged catalogue of a
choice collection of books, which cost the Abbé fifty years
of pretty constant labour in amassing. Prefixed, are some
interesting notices of MSS.: and, among them, of a valuable
one of Froissart. The prints of the Abbé were afterwards
sold, from a catalogue of 143 pages, printed at Lisle in the
same year.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Du Fresne.</span> <i>Raphaelis Tricheti du Fresne
Bibliothecæ Catalogus.</i> Paris, 1662, 4to. "I have observed,"
says Morhof, "a number of authors in this catalogue which I
have in vain sought after elsewhere. The typographical
errors (especially in regard to dates, adds Baillet) are
innumerable: and the theological, legal, and medical works,
comparatively few&mdash;but in the departments of history,
antiquities, and general literature, this collection is
wonderfully enriched&mdash;containing authors hardly ever heard
of." <i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>, vol. i., p. 212. Colomiés and
Labbe unite in conferring the highest praises upon Du Fresne
and his collection. See the <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 143; where, however, the confused and inaccurate manner
in which the catalogue is executed is sharply censured by
Baillet. Morhof informs us that this collection was disposed
of by Du Fresne's widow, to the Royal Library, for 24,000
<i>livres</i>, after she had refused 33,000 for the
same.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gaignat.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres du Cabinet de feu M.
Louis Jean Gaignat, disposé et mis en ordre par Guill.
François de Bure le Jeune.</i> Paris, 1769, 8vo., two vols. One
of the best executed, and most intrinsically valuable
catalogues in existence. Almost all the books of Gaignat
were in the choicest condition; being the cream of the
collections of Colbert, Préfond, and De Boze. The possession
of this rare catalogue, which is indispensable to the
collector, forms what is called a Supplement to De Bure's
"<i>Bibliographie Instructive</i>." There are 50 copies struck
off upon <span class="smcap">small quarto</span> paper, to arrange with a like number
of this latter work. Consult <i>Bibl. Crevenn.</i>, vol. v., p.
291.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Genève.</span> <i>Catalogue raisonné des Manuscrits conservés
dans la bibliothéque, &amp;c., de Genève; par Jean Senibier.</i>
Genève, 1779, 8vo. A neatly executed and useful catalogue of
some manuscripts of no mean value. It has received a good
character by Mons. Van-Praet, in the <i>Cat. de la Valliere</i>,
vol. iii., n<span class="super">o</span>. 5542. See also <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>, ante.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Goez.</span>
<i>Bibliothecæ Goësinæ Catalogus</i>, Leidæ, 1687, 8vo. A fine
collection of books and of coins distinguished the Museum of
Goez.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Golowkin.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres de la Bibliothéque
du Comte Alexis de Golowkin</i>, Leipsic, 1798, 4to. It is said
that <span class="smcap">only 25 copies</span> of this catalogue were struck off, and
that not more than two of these are known to be in France.
Neither the type nor paper has the most inviting aspect; but
it is a curious volume, and contains a description of books
"infiniment précieux." Consult Peignot's <i>Bibliogr.
Curieuse</i>, p. 31. Dr. Clarke, in his <i>Travels in Russia,
&amp;c.</i>, p. 138, has noticed the extraordinary library of Count
Botterline, but says nothing of Golowkin's.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gouttard</span>.
<i>Catalogue des Livres rares et precieux de feu M. Gouttarde
par Guillaume de Bure fils aîné.</i> Paris, 1780, 8vo. A short
bibliographical notice of the amiable and tasteful owner of
this select collection precedes the description of the
books. The bibliographical observations are sometimes
copious and valuable. This catalogue is indispensable to the
collector.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guyon.</span> <i>Catalogue des livres de la
Bibliothéque de feu M.J.B. Denis Guyon, Chev. Seigneur de
Sardiere, Ancien Capitaine au Regiment du Roi, et l'un des
Seigneurs du Canal de Briare.</i> Paris, 1759, 8vo. It is
justly said, in the "advertisement" prefixed to this
catalogue, that, in running over the different classes of
which the collection is composed, there will be found
articles "capable de piquer la curiosité des bibliophiles."
In ancient and modern poetry, and in romances&mdash;especially
relating to chivalry&mdash;this "ancient Captain" appears to have
been deeply versed. The advertisement is followed by 28
pages of "Eclaircissemens"&mdash;which give an interesting
account of some precious manuscripts of old poetry and
romances. A MS. note, in my copy of this catalogue, informs
me that the books were sold "en masse."&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Heinsius.</span> (<span class="smcap">Nic.</span>)
<i>Nicolai Heinsii Bibliothecæ Catalogus</i>, (1682) 8vo. A
portrait of the elegant and learned owner of this collection
faces the title-page. The books contained in it are
remarkable both for their rarity and intrinsic value; and a
great number of them were enriched with the notes of
Scaliger, Salmasius, and others. Few collections display
more judgment and taste in the selection than the present
one; and few critics have been of more essential service to
the cause of ancient classical literature than Nicholas
Heinsius. He excelled particularly in his editions of the
poets. Mr. Dyer, of Exeter, the bookseller, has a copy of
this catalogue, which was formerly Grævius's; in which that
celebrated critic has made marginal remarks concerning the
rarity and value of certain works described in
it.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hohendorf.</span> <i>Bibliotheca Hohendorfiana; ou Catalogue
de la Bibliothéque de feu Mons. George Guillaume Baron de
Hohendorf: à la Haye</i>, 1720, 8vo., three parts. A
magnificent collection; which a MS. note, by Dr. Farmer (in
my copy of the catalogue), informs me was "added to the
Emperor's library at Vienna." In the <i>Bibl. Mencken</i>, p. 10,
it is thus loftily described: "Catalogus per-rarus
rarissimis libris superbiens."&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hoym.</span> <i>Catalogus Librorum
Bibliothecæ Caroli Henrici Comitis de Hoym</i>, 1738, 8vo. This
catalogue, which is exceedingly well "digested by Martin,"
is a great favourite with collectors. A copy out of Count
Hoym's collection tells well&mdash;whether at a book-sale, or in
a bookseller's catalogue. There are copies upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>,
which, when priced, sell high.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hulsius.</span> <i>Bibliotheca
Hulsiana, sive Catalogus Librorum quos magno labore, summa
cura et maximis sumptibus collegit Vir Consularis Samuel
Hulsius.</i> Hag. Com. 1730, four vols. 8vo. (the second and
third being in two parts, and the fourth in three). This is,
in sober truth, a wonderful collection of books; containing
nearly 34,000 articles&mdash;which, allowing three volumes to an
article, would make the owner to have been in possession of
100,000 volumes of printed books and MSS. The English
library, (vol. iv., pt. ii.) of nearly 3300 articles,
comprehended nearly all the best books of the day. There
were about 1200 articles of Spanish Literature. Nor was the
worthy Consul deficient in the love of the fine arts ("hæc
est, sitque diu, Senis optimi voluptas et oblectatio," says
the compiler of the catalogue); having 11,000 most beautiful
prints of subjects relating to the Bible, bound up in 92
atlas folio volumes. Long live the memory of Hulsius; a
consular hero of no ordinary renown!&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jena.</span> <i>Memorabilia
Bibliothecæ Academicæ Jenensis: sive designatio Codicum
manuscriptorum illa Bibliothecâ et Librorum impressorum

referred to by Vogt and Panzer. It is uncommon.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jesu Soc.</span>
<i>Bibliotheca Scriptorum Societatis Jesu.</i> Antv., 1643. Romæ,
1676, fol. Although this work is not a professed catalogue
of books, yet, as it contains an account of the writings of
those learned men who were in the society of the
Jesuits&mdash;and as Baillet, Antonio, and Morhof, have said
every thing in commendation of it&mdash;I strongly recommend one
or the other of these editions to the bibliographer's
attention. I possess the edition of 1643; and have
frequently found the most satisfactory intelligence on
referring to it. How clever some of the Jesuits were in
their ideas of the arrangement of a library may be seen from
their "<i>Systema Bibliothecæ Jesuitarum Collegii
Ludoviciani</i>"&mdash;which was written by Garnier for the private
use of the Louvain college, and which is now extremely
difficult to be found. See Maichelius, <i>de Præcip. Bibl.
Parisiens</i>, p. 128. Their "<i>Systema bibliothecæ collegii
Parisiensis societatis Jesu</i>," 1678, 4to. (or catalogue of
books in the college of Clermont), is handsomely noticed by
Camus in the <i>Mem. de l'Inst.</i>, vol. i., 647.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Just, St.</span>

Bibliothéque de M. Merard de St. Just, ancien maitre-d'hotêl
de Monsieur, frère du Roi (avec les prix d'achat).</i> Paris,
1783, 18mo. Of this book, printed upon superfine paper, of
the manufactory of d'Annonay, only 25 copies were struck
off. <i>Bibl. Curieuse</i>, p. 43. Another catalogue of the same
collection (perhaps a more copious one) was put forth in
1799, 8vo., prepared by M. Mauger, See <i>Diction.

complectentis. Libros collegit et Literariis Catalogum
Animadversionibus instruxit, B.N. Krohn. Editio altera.</i>
Hamb. 1796, 8vo. The preface to this very excellent
collection of books is written in Latin by Rambach; and a
most interesting one it is. After giving a slight sketch of
the life and literary occupations of Krohn, he thus finishes
the picture of his death&mdash;"Ego certe (exclaims the grateful
biographer), mi <span class="smcap">Krohni</span>, te amabo, et quamdiu 'spiritus hos
reget artus' gratam Tui memoriam ex animo nunquam elabi
patiar. O! me felicem, si, qua olim me beasti, amicitiâ nunc

beatorum sedes evocaverit, ac Te mihi rediderit
conjunctissimum. Vale, interim, pia anima; et quem jam
tristem reliquisti, prope diem exspecta, in tenerrimos Tuos
amplexus properantem, ac de summa, quam nunc habes,
felicitate Tibi congratulantem," p. xix. This is the genuine
language of heart-felt grief; language, which those who have
lost an old and good friend will know well how to
appreciate. This catalogue, which was given to me by my
friend the Rev. Dr. Gosset, 'vir in re bibliographicâ
<span lang="el" title="Greek: polymathestatos">&#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>,' exhibits a fine collection of
books (3821 in number) relating to history and philology.
Some of Krohn's notes are sufficiently shrewd and
intelligent.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamoignon.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres Imprimés et

bibliographer has only to hear Peignot speak in his own
language, and he will not long hesitate about the price to
be given for so precious <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 'a' missing in original">volume</span>: "Catalogue fort rare, tiré a <span class="smcap">quinze

Latin prefece, which may be seen in the <i>Jugemens des

Livres de la Bibliothéque de feu M. de Lamoignon, Garde de
Sçeaux de France.</i> Paris, 1791, 8vo., 3 vols. These volumes
contain the sale catalogue of Lamoignon's books as they were
purchased by Mr. T. Payne, the bookseller. Like the great
libraries of Crevenna and Pinelli, this immense collection
(with the exception of the works upon French jurisprudence)
has been dissipated by public sale. It yet delights Mr.
Payne to think and to talk of the many thousand volumes
which were bound in Morocco, or Russia, or
white-calf-leather, "with gilt on the edges"&mdash;which this
extraordinary family of book-collectors had amassed with so
much care and assiduity. The preface gives us a short, but
pleasing, account of the bibliomanical spirit of Lamoignon's
father-in-law, Monsieur Berryer; who spent between thirty
and forty years in enriching this collection with all the
choice, beautiful, and extraordinary copies of works which,
from his ministerial situation, and the exertions of his
book-friends, it was possible to obtain. M. Berryer died in
1762, and his son-in-law in 1789.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lamoignon.</span> <i>Des Livres

have been "buried in the benedictions of his

Bourdaloue.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lemarié.</span> <i>Catalogue des livres de feu M.

collection of Greek and Latin Literature, which evinces a
man of taste and judgment. Nothing can be more handsomely
said of a collection than what De Bure has prefixed to the
present one. In the <i>Cat. de Gouttard</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 1545, I find
a copy of it upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Loménie.</span> <i>Index Librorum
ab inventa Typographia da annum 1500, &amp;c., cum notis, &amp;c.</i>
Senonis, 1791, 8vo., two vols. The owner of this collection,
whose name does not appear in the title-page, was the
celebrated Cardinal <span class="smcap">de Loménie de Brienne</span>: who is described,
in the advertisement prefixed to the catalogue of his books
in 1797, [vide <a href="#Lomenie">infra</a>] as having, from almost early youth,
pushed his love of book-collecting to an excess hardly
equalled by any of his predecessors. When he was but a young
ecclesiastic, and had only the expectation of a fortune, his
ruling passion for books, and his attachment to fellow
bibliomaniacs, was ardent and general. But let his
panegyrist speak in his own language&mdash;"Si le hazard
procuroit à ses amis quelque objét précieux, il n'avoit de
repos qu'aprés l'avoir obtenu; les sacrifices ne
l'effrayoient pas; il étoit né généreaux; mais ce qu'on lui
accordoit, il le devoit sur-tout à ses manières insinuantes.
Ses sollicitations étoient toujours assaisonnées d'un ton
d'amabilité auquel on résistoit difficilement. Lorsque le
tems et les grâces de la cour eurent aggrandi ses moyens,
ses veus s'etendirent à proportion. Insensiblement il
embressa tous les genres, et sa bibliothéque devint un dépôt
universel. Dans ses fréquens voyages, s'il s'arrêtoit
quelques instans dans une ville, on le voyoit visiter
lui-même les libraries, s'introduire dans les maisons
religieuses, s'insinuer dans les cabinets d'amateurs,
chercher par-tout à acquérir; c'etoit un besoin pour lui
d'acheter sans cesse, d'entasser les volumes. Cette passion
a peut-être ses excés; mais du moins, elle ne fut pas pour
le cardinal de Loménie une manie stérile. Non seulement il
aimoit, il connoissoit les livres, mais il savoit s'en
servir; sans contredit il fut un des hommes les plus
éclairés du Clergé de France."&mdash;&mdash;To return from this
pleasing rhapsody to the catalogue, the title of which is
above given. It is composed by Laire, in the Latin language,
with sufficient bibliographical skill: but the index is the
most puzzling one imaginable. The uncommonly curious and
magnificent collection, not being disposed of "en
masse"&mdash;according to advertisement&mdash;was broken up; and the
more ancient books were sold by auction at Paris, in 1792,
from a French catalogue prepared by De Bure. Some of the
books were purchased by Mr. Edwards, and sold at London in
the Paris collection [vide <a href="#Page_90">p. 90</a>, post]; as were also those
relating to Natural History; which latter were sold by
auction without his Eminence's name: but it is a gross error
in the <i>Bibl. Krohn</i>, p. 259, n<span class="super">o</span>. 3466, to say that many
of these books were impious and obscene. These are scarce
and dear volumes; and as they supply some deficiencies

with a rich sprinkling of Italian literature; leaving
behind, however, a surplus of not fewer than twelve hundred
pieces relating to the Italian Drama&mdash;many of them
rare&mdash;which were to be sold at a future auction. From the
biographical memoir prefixed to this catalogue, I have given
the preceding extract concerning the character of the owner

These books were sold in January, 1780; and great things are
said, in the advertisement, of their rarity and beauty. The
Count Macarthy has, at this moment, one of the most
magnificent collections upon the continent. His books
printed <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span> are unequalled by those of any private

magnificent and truly valuable publication (with excellent

birth and bibliographical powers, it may be as well to
contemplate his expressive physiognomy.

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magliabechi</span> was born at Florence October 29, 1633. His
parents, of low and mean rank, were well satisfied when they
got him into the service of a man who sold herbs and fruit.
He had never learned to read; and yet he was perpetually
poring over the leaves of old books that were used in his
master's shop. A bookseller, who lived in the neighbourhood,
and who had often observed this, and knew the boy could not
read, asked him one day "what he meant by staring so much on
printed paper?" Magliabechi said that "he did not know how
it was, but that he loved it of all things." The consequence
was that he was received, with tears of joy in his eyes,
into the bookseller's shop; and hence rose, by a quick
succession, into posts of literary honour, till he became
librarian to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In this situation
Magliabechi had nothing further, or more congenial to his
feelings, to sigh for: in the Florentine library he revelled
without cessation in the luxury of book-learning. The
strength of his memory was remarkable; one day, the Grand
Duke sent for him to ask whether he could procure a book
that was particularly scarce. "No, sir," answered
Magliabechi, "it is impossible; for there is but one in the
world, and that is in the Grand Signior's Library at
Constantinople, and is the seventh book on the second shelf
on the right hand as you go in." In spite of his cobwebs,
dirt, and cradle lined with books, Magliabechi reached his
81st year. Hearne has contrived to interweave the following
(rather trifling) anecdote of him, in his <i>Johan. Confrat.,
&amp;c., de Reb. Glaston</i>, vol. ii., 486&mdash;which I give merely
because it is the fashion to covet every thing which
appertaineth to Tom Hearne. "I have mentioned the bank where
the MSS. (concerning the Epistles of St. Ignatius; Bank
<span class="smcap">lvii</span>.) stands, and the title of the book, because Vossius
tells us not in his preface which of the several MSS. in
this library he made use of; and to finde it out gave me so
much trouble that, if the Grand Duke's library-keeper had
not known the book, and searched it for me, I think I should
never have met with it, there being not one canon of St.
Laurence, not their library-keeper himself, nor, I believe,
any other in Florence, except this S<span class="super">re</span>. <span class="smcap">Magliabechi</span>, that
could direct me to it. The learned Bishop will be pleased to
take notice of S<span class="super">re</span>.
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Magliabechi's">Maliabechi's</span> civility; who, besides procuring me the Grand
Duke's leave to collate the epistles, attended himself in
the library, all the time I was there (the licence being
granted by the Grand Duke upon this condition): and since,
as a mark of his respect to the reverend bishop, hath been
pleased to present him with a book (about the Florentine
history) which I have committed to Mr. Ferne, my Lord
Lexinton's Gentleman, to be conveyed to his lordship." (Mr.
Ledgerd's account of his collations of the Florentine MS.
with the edition of Vossius.)&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Mark.</span> <i>Græca D. Marci

of curious fac-similes of all sorts of things. It was begun
to be printed in 1752, but Biscioni's death, in May, 1756,
prevented the completion of the publication 'till May 1757.

1774; 5 vols., folio. An equally splendid work with the
preceding&mdash;and much more copious and erudite in regard to
intrinsically valuable matter. The indexes are excellent. No
extensive philological library should be without these
volumes&mdash;especially since the name of <span class="smcap">Medici</span> has recently
become so popular, from the able biographical memoirs of the
family by Mr. Roscoe.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Menarsiana.</span> <i>Bibliotheca
Menarsiana; ou Catalogue de la Bibliothéque de feu Messire
Jean Jaques Charron, Chevalier Marquis de Menars</i>, &amp;c. A La
Haye, 1720, 8vo. A very fine collection of books in all
branches of literature. After the "Ordo Venditionis," there
is an additional leaf pasted in, signifying that a
magnificent copy of Fust's bible of 1462, upon paper, would
be sold immediately after the theological MSS. in folio. It
brought the sum of 1200 florins. The sale commenced at nine
and at two; giving the buyers time to digest their

uncommon books in this collection; which evince the taste
and judgment of Menckenius, who was a scholar of no mean
reputation. Perhaps the word "rare" is too lavishly bestowed
upon some of the books described in it.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Meon.</span> <i>Catalogue

If the reader has chanced to cast his eye over the account
of the Abbé de St. Leger, at <a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>, ante, he will not
hesitate long about procuring a copy of the catalogue of the
library of so truly eminent a bibliographer.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mérigot.</span>
<i>Catalogue des livres de M.J.G. Mérigot, Libraire</i>, par M.
De Bure, 1800, 8vo. It is very seldom that this catalogue
appears in our own country: which is the more provoking as
the references to it, in foreign bibliographical works,
render its possession necessary to the collector. Mérigot
was an eminent bookseller, and prepared a good catalogue of
M. Lorry's library, which was sold in 1791, 8vo.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
Michael.</span> <i>Bibliotheca Codicum Manuscriptorum Monasterij
Sancti Michaelis Venetiarum, una cum appendice librorum
impressorum sæculi</i> xv. <i>Opus posthumum Joannis Bened.
Mittarelli.</i> Venet., 1779, folio. It were much to be wished
that, after the example of this and other monasteries, all
religious houses, which have large libraries attached to
them, would publish accounts of their MSS. and printed
books. There is no knowing what treasures are hid in them,
and of which the literary world must remain ignorant, unless
they are thus introduced to general notice. How many curious
and amusing anecdotes may be told of precious works being
discovered under barbarous titles! Among others, take,
gentle reader, the two following ones&mdash;relating to books of
a very different character. Within a volume, entitled
<i>Secreta Alberti</i>, were found "<i>The Fruyte of Redempcyon</i>,"
printed by W. De Worde, 1532, 4to.; and a hitherto
imperfectly described impression of <i>The Boke of Fyshinge</i>,
printed by W. De Worde, in 4to., without date; which usually
accompanies that fascinating work, ycleped Dame Juliana
Barnes's <i>Boke of Hawkyng, Huntyng, and Cote Armoor</i>. My
friend Mr. J. Haslewood first made me acquainted with this
rare treasure&mdash;telling me he had "a famous tawny little
volume" to shew me: his pulse, at the same time, I ween,
beating one hundred and five to the minute! The second
anecdote more exactly accords with the nature of my
preliminary observations. In one of the libraries abroad,
belonging to the Jesuits, there was a volume entitled, on
the back of it "<i>Concilium Tridenti</i>:" the searching eye and
active hands of a well-educated Bibliomaniac discovered and
opened this volume&mdash;when lo! instead of the <i>Council of
Trent</i>, appeared the <i>First</i>, and almost unknown, <i>Edition</i>
of the <i>Decameron of Boccaccio</i>! This precious volume is now
reposing upon the deserted shelves of the late Duke of
Roxburgh's library; and, at the forth-coming sale of the
same, it will be most vigorously contended for by all the
higher and more knowing powers of the bibliographical world;</p>

<p><a name="Mirabeau" id="Mirabeau"></a><span class="smcap">Mirabeau.</span> <i>Catalogue de la Bibliotheque de Mirabeau l'aîné,
par Rozet</i>, 1792, 8vo. A fine collection of books; some of
them very curious and uncommon. At the head of the choice
things contained in it must be noticed the "Recueil de
Calques, ou dessins des titres et figure d'un grand nombre
des plus anciens ouvrages, gravés en bois, ou imprimés en
caractères mobiles, depuis l'origine de l'imprimerie," &amp;c.
These designs were 226 in number; of which a description is
given at the head of the catalogue. They were purchased for
1105 livres, and again sold, with the same description
prefixed, at the last Crevenna sale of 1793 (see <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>,
ante). Consult the <i>Curiosités Bibliographiques</i> of Peignot,

<i>Bibliotheca Bibliothecarum Manuscriptorum nova, autore De
Bern. de Montfauçon</i>, Paris, 1739, folio, two vols. These
are the bibliographical works (which I thought would be
acceptable if placed in this list of Catalogues) of the
illustrious Montfauçon; whose publications place him on the
summit of antiquarian fame. So much solid sense, careful
enquiry, curious research, and not despicable taste, mark
his voluminous productions! The bibliographer may rest
assured that he will not often be led into confusion or
error in the perusal of the above curious and valuable
volumes, which have always been considered precious by the
philologist.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Morelli.</span> <i>Jacobi Morellii Bibliothecæ Regiæ

Venice; and this catalogue of his Greek and Latin MSS. is
given upon the authority of Peignot's <i>Curiosités
Bibliographiques</i>, p. lix.&mdash;&mdash;<a name="Museum" id="Museum"></a><span class="smcap">Museum British.</span> <i>Catalogus

Impress., &amp;c.</i>, Lond., 1787, folio, 2 vols. These are the
published catalogues of the literary treasures, in
manuscript and in print, which are contained in the British
Museum. The <i>first Cottonian</i> catalogue has a life of Sir
Robert Cotton, and an account of his library prefixed to it.
The <i>second</i>, by Samuel Hooper, was intended "to remedy the
many defects" in the preceding catalogue, and "the
injudicious manner" in which it was compiled; but it is of
itself sufficiently confused and imperfect. The <i>third</i>,
which is the most copious and valuable, with an index (and
which has an abridged account of Sir Robert Cotton, and of
his Library), was drawn up by Mr. Planta, the principal
librarian of the British Museum. A great part of the first
catalogue of the <i>Harleian MSS.</i> was compiled by the
celebrated Humphrey Wanley, and a most valuable and ably
executed publication it is! The <i>Second</i> is executed by the
Rev. R. Nares: it contains the preface of the first, with an
additional one by himself, and a copious index; rendering
this the most complete catalogue of MSS. which has ever yet
appeared in our own country; although one regrets that its
typographical execution should not have kept pace with its
intrinsic utility. The two latter catalogues of MSS. above
described give an account of those which were presented by
royal munificence, and collected chiefly by Sir Hans Sloane
and Dr. Birch. The catalogue of 1734 (which is now rare) was
compiled by David Casley: that of 1782, by Samuel Ascough.
Of the catalogue of <i>Printed Books</i>, it would be unfair to
dwell upon its imperfections, since a new, and greatly
enlarged and improved, impression of it is about going to
press, under the editorial care and inspection of Messrs. H.
Ellis and Baber, the gentlemen to whom the printed books are
at present intrusted. Mr. Douce, who has succeeded Mr. Nares
as head librarian of the MSS., is busily employed in
examining the multifarious collection of the <i>Lansdowne
MSS.</i> (recently purchased by the Trustees of the Museum),
and we may hope that the day is not very far distant when
the public are to be congratulated on his minute and
masterly analysis of these treasures.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paris.</span> <i>Catalogue

8vo. <i>Bibliotheca elegantissima Parisina, par M. Lourent</i>,
1790, 8vo. <i>The same</i>: Lond., 1791, 8vo. Since the days of
Gaignat and the Duke de la Valliere, the longing eyes of
bibliographers were never blessed with a sight of more
splendid and choice books than were those in the possession
of <span class="smcap">M. Paris de Meyzieux</span>. The Spira Virgil of 1470, <span class="smcap">upon
vellum</span>, will alone confer celebrity upon the <i>first</i>
catalogue&mdash;but what shall we say to the <i>second</i>? It
consists of only 635 articles, and yet, as is well observed
in the preface, it was never equalled for the like number.
Happy is that noviciate in bibliography who can forget the
tedium of a rainy day in sitting by the side of a log-wood
fire, and in regaling his luxurious fancy, by perusing the
account of "fine, magnificent, matchless, large paper," and
"vellum" copies which are thickly studded from one end of
this volume to the other. Happier far the veteran, who can
remember how he braved the <i>perils of the sale</i>, in
encountering the noble and heavy metalled competitors who
flocked, from all parts of the realm, to partake of these
<i>Parisian</i> spoils! Such a one casts an eye upon his
well-loaded shelves, and while he sees here and there a
yellow morocco Aldus, or a Russian leather Froben, he
remembers how bravely he fought for each, and with what
success his exertions were crowned! For my own part, gentle
reader, I frankly assure thee that&mdash;after having seen the
"<span class="smcap">Heures de Notre Dame</span>," written by the famous Jarry, and
decorated with <span class="smcap">seven</span> small exquisite paintings of the Virgin
and Christ&mdash;and the <i>Aldine Petrarch</i> and <i>Virgil</i> of 1501,
all of them executed upon <span class="smcap">snow-white vellum</span>&mdash;after having
seen only these books out of the Paris collection, I hope to
descend to my obscure grave in perfect peace and
satisfaction! The reader may smile; but let him turn to

the <i>Cat. de la Valliere</i>; and <i>Curiositès

bibliographique," ought not to make me forget to observe
that we are indebted to the enterprising spirit and correct
taste of Mr. Edwards for these, as well as for many other,
beautiful books imported from the Continent. Nor is it yet
forgotten that some thorough-bred bibliomaniacs, in their
way to the sale, used to call for a glass of ice, to allay
the contagious inflammation which might rage in the
auction-room. And now take we leave of Monsieur Paris de
Meyzieux. Peace to the ashes of so renowned a
book-chevalier.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Petau et Mansart.</span> <i>Bibliotheca Potavina

question about the priority, in point both of typographical
beauty and intrinsic excellence, of these catalogues; the
latter being only a common sale one, with the abridgment of
the learned preface of Morelli, and of his bibliographical
notices. This immense collection (of the ancient owners of
which we have a short sketch in Morhof, vol. i., pp. 28,
202) was purchased by Messrs. Edwards and Robson: the Greek
and Latin books were sold for 6786<i>l.</i>, the Italian, for
2570<i>l.</i>&mdash;which barely repaid the expenses of purchase,
including duties, carriage, and sale. Although, as Dr.
Harwood has observed, "there being no dust in Venice, this
most magnificent library has in general lain reposited for
some centuries, in excellent preservation,"&mdash;yet the copies
were not, upon the whole, in the choicest condition. There
are copies of the catalogue of 1789 upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>. The
catalogue of 1787 (with an elegant portrait of Pinelli
prefixed) has, at first sight, the aspect of a work printed
in small quarto.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pompadour.</span> <i>Catalogue des Livres de la
Bibliothéque de feue Madame La Marquise de Pompadour, Dame
du Palais de la Reine</i>, Paris, 1765, 8vo. The name of Madame
de Pompadour will be always respected by bibliographers, on
account of the taste and judgment which are displayed in
this elegant collection. The old popular romances form the
leading feature; but there is an ample sprinkling of the
belles-lettres and poetry. An animated eulogium is
pronounced upon Mad. de Pompadour by Jardé, in his "Précis

excellent catalogue, which cost the compiler of it,
Fontanini, nine years of hard labour, is a most useful and
valuable one; serving as a model for catalogues of large
libraries. See the more minute criticism upon it in <i>Cat. de

title-page, but luckily contains the Latin preface, was
formerly Ruddiman's. The volume has 738 pages: this is
noticed because all the appendixes and addenda are
comprehended in the same.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Revickzky.</span> <i>Bibliotheca Græca

paravi.</i> <span class="smcap">Periergus Deltophilus</span> (the feigned name for
<span class="smcap">Revickzky</span>), Berolini, 1784: 1794, 8vo. It was the delight of
Count Revickzky, the original owner of this collection, to
devote his time and attention to the acquisition of scarce,
beautiful, and valuable books; and he obtained such fame in
this department of literature as to cause him to be ranked
with the Vallieres, Pinellis, and Loménies of the day. He
compiled, and privately disposed of, the catalogue of his
collection, which bears the above title; and to some few of
which are prefixed a letter to M. L' A.D. [enini] (Member of
the French Academy) and a preface. <i>Three Supplements</i> to
this catalogue were also, from time to time, circulated by
him; so that the purchaser must look sharply after these
acquisitions to his copy&mdash;as some one or the other of them
are generally missing. Peignot supposes there are only <i>two</i>
supplements. <i>Bibl. Curieuse</i>, p. 58. When Count Revickzky
came over to England, he made an offer to Earl Spencer to
dispose of the whole collection to his lordship, for a
certain "round sum" to be paid immediately into his hands,
and to receive, in addition, a yearly sum by way of annuity.
So speaks fame. Shortly after this contract was closed, the
Count died; and Earl Spencer, in consequence, for a
comparatively small sum (the result of an immediate and
generous compliance with the Count's wishes!), came into the
possession of a library which, united with his previous
magnificent collection, and the successful ardour with which
he has since continued the pursuit, places him quite at the
head of all the collectors in Europe&mdash;for early, rare,
precious, and beautiful, books. Long may he possess such
treasures!&mdash;and fleeing from the turbulence of politics, and
secluded as he is, both in the metropolis and at Althorp,
from the stunning noise of a city, may he always exclaim,
with Horace, as the Count did before  him&mdash;</p>

interesting to the collector.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Du Roi</span> [Louis XV.]

six vols. The most beautiful and carefully executed
catalogue in the world: reflecting a truly solid lustre upon
the literary reputation of France! The first four volumes,
written in Latin, comprehend an account of MSS.: the six
last, written in French, of printed works in <span class="smcap">Theology</span>,
<span class="smcap">Jurisprudence</span>, and <span class="smcap">Belles-Lettres</span>; the departments of
<span class="smcap">History</span> and the <span class="smcap">Arts and Sciences</span> still remaining to be
executed. De Bure told us, half a century ago, that the
"Gens de Lettres" were working hard at the completion of it;
but the then complaints of bibliographers at its imperfect
state are even yet continued in Fournier's last edition of
his <i>Dictionnaire Portatif de Bibliographie</i>, p. 468. So
easy it is to talk; so difficult to execute! I believe,
however, that M. Van-Praet, one of the principal librarians,
is now putting all engines to work to do away the further
disgrace of such unaccountably protracted negligence. My
copy of this magnificent set of books is bound in red
Morocco, gilt leaves, and was a presentation one from the
King "au Comte de Neny, comme une marque de son estime,
1770." I should add that the first volume of "Theology"
contains a history of the rise and progress of the royal
library, which was reprinted in 8vo., 1782.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Du Roi.</span>
<i>Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits de la Bibliothéque du

will be obvious to the candid reader that this work could
not be better introduced than in the present place; and a
most interesting and valuable one it is! My copy of it,
which is only in six volumes [but a seventh is mentioned in
<i>Cat. de Boutourlin</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 3845, and in Caillot's <i>Roman
Bibliographique</i>, p. 195], was purchased by me of Mr. Evans
of Pall-Mall, who had shewn it to several lovers of
bibliography, but none of whom had courage or curiosity
enough to become master of the volumes. How I have profited
by them, the Supplement to my first volume of the
"Typographical Antiquities of Great Britain," may in part
shew. The public shall be made acquainted with still more
curious excerpts. In my humble judgment the present work is
a model of extraction of the marrow of old MSS. It may be
worth adding, the plates in the sixth volume are singular,
curious and beautiful.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Du Roi.</span> <i>Accounts and Extracts of

be followed"&mdash;says the opening of the translator's preface.
The present volumes contain a translation of only twenty-two

be recommended to the curious philologist, as well as to the
thorough-bred bibliomaniac.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Röver.</span> <i>Bibliotheca

elegant and pleasing Latin preface to this most carefully
compiled catalogue, we learn that the owner of the books
lived to his 82d year&mdash;and [what must be a peculiar
gratification to Bibliomaniacs] that he beat Pomponius
Atticus in the length of time during which he never had
occasion to take physic; namely, 50 years! Röver's life
seemed to glide away in rational tranquillity, and in total
seclusion from the world; except that he professed and
always shewed the greatest kindness to his numerous, and
many of them helpless, relatives&mdash;"vix in publicum prodiit,
nisi cultus Divini externi aut propinquorum caussâ," p. xv.
His piety was unshaken. Like the venerable Jacob Bryant, his
death was hastened in consequence of a contusion in his leg
from a fall in endeavouring to reach a book.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rothelin.</span>
<i>Catalogue des livres de feu M'L. Abbé D'Orleans de

of the library of the amiable and learned Abbé Rothelin,
"known (says Camus) for his fine taste for beautiful books,"
is judiciously drawn up by Martin, who was the De Bure of
his day. A portrait of its owner faces the title-page. It
was the Abbé Rothelin who presented De Boze with the
celebrated '<i>Guirlande de Julie</i>'&mdash;a work which afterwards
came into the Valliere collection, and was sold for 14,510
livres,&mdash;"the highest price (says Peignot) ever given for a
modern book." Consult his <i>Curiosités Bibliographiques</i>, pp.

frequently referred to by bibliographers, should not escape
the collector when he can obtain it for a few shillings. A
tolerably good preface or diatribe is prefixed, upon the
causes of the rarity of Books, but the volume itself is not
deserving of all the fine things in commendation of it which
are said in the <i>Bibl. Reiman</i>, pt. ii., p. 671,

help giving the present catalogue a place in one's
collection. According to <i>Bibl. Solger.</i>, vol. iii., n<span class="super">o</span>.

extensive collection of interesting works; with a
sufficiently copious index at the end of the fourth volume.
The fifth volume contains a curious disquisition upon the
antiquity of signatures, catchwords, and numerals; and is
enriched with a number of plates of watermarks of the paper
in ancient books. This catalogue, which is rarely seen in
our own country, is well worth a place in any library. It is
a pity the typographical execution of it is so very
indifferent. For the credit of a bibliographical taste, I
hope there were a few copies struck off upon <span class="smcap">large
paper</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sion College.</span> <i>Catalogus universalis librorum

Londini, 1650, 4to. <i>Ejusdem Collegii librorum Catalogus,

catalogues (of a collection which contains some very curious
and generally unknown volumes) was published before the
great fire of London happened, there will be found some
books in it which were afterwards consumed, and therefore
not described in the subsequent impression of 1724. This
latter, which Tom Osborne, the bookseller, would have called
a "pompous volume," is absolutely requisite to the
bibliographer: but both impressions should be procured, if
possible. The folio edition is common and cheap.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smith</span>

and very valuable library of Joseph Smith, Esq., His
Britannic Majesty's Consul at Venice, lately deceased</i>,
1773, 8vo. These are the catalogues of the collections of
books occasionally formed at Venice, by Mr. Joseph Smith,
during his consulship there. The quarto impression contains
a description of the books which were purchased "en masse"
by his present majesty. It is singularly well executed by
Paschali, comprehending, by way of an appendix, the prefaces
to those volumes in the collection which were printed in the
fifteenth century. I possess a brochûre of 71 pages,
containing a catalogue of books printed in the fifteenth
century, which has Consul Smith's arms at the beginning,
and, at the end, this subscription, "Pretiosissima hæc
librorum collectio, cujusvis magni principis Bibliotheca
dignissima, constat voluminibus ccxlviii." The title-page
has no date. I suspect it to be the same catalogue of books
which is noticed at <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>, ante, and which probably the
Consul bought: forming the greater part of his own library
of early printed books. See too the <i>Bibliogr. Miscellany</i>,
vol. ii., 72. The collection of 1773 was sold by auction,
for Mr. Robson, by Messrs. Baker and Leigh&mdash;and a fine one
it was. Among these books, the Spira Virgil of 1470, printed
<span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>, was purchased for <i>only twenty-five guineas</i>!</p>

publication "facile princeps Catalogorum"&mdash;in its way. The
bibliographical notices are frequent and full; and saving
that the words "rarus, rarior, et rarissimus," are sometimes
too profusely bestowed, nothing seems to be wanting to
render this a very first rate acquisition to the collector's
library. I am indebted to the bibliomanical spirit of honest
Mr. Manson, of Gerard-street, the bookseller, for this
really useful publication.&mdash;&mdash;<a name="Soubise" id="Soubise"></a><span class="smcap">Soubise.</span> <i>Catalogue des livres
imprimés et manuscrits, &amp;c., de feu Monseigneur Le Prince de
Soubise (par feu Le Clerc)</i>, Paris, 1788, 8vo. A short
history of this collection will be the best inducement to
purchase the present catalogue, whenever it comes in the way
of the collector. The foundation of this splendid library
was that of the famous De Thou's [vide Art. <a href="#Thuanus"><span class="smcap">Thuanus</span></a>, post],
which was purchased by the Cardinal de Rohan, who added it
to his own grand collection&mdash;"the fruit of a fine taste and
a fine fortune." It continued to be augmented and enriched
'till, and after, it came into the possession of the <span class="smcap">Prince
de Soubise</span>&mdash;the last nobleman of his name&mdash;who dying in
January, 1789, the entire collection was dispersed by public
auction: after it had been offered for the purchase of one
or two eminent London booksellers, who have repented, and
will repent to their dying day, their declining the offer.
This catalogue is most unostentatiously executed upon very
indifferent paper; and, while an excellent index enables us
to discover any work of which we may be in want, the
beautiful copies from this collection which are in the
Cracherode library in the British Museum, give
unquestionable proof of the splendour of the books. For the
credit of French bibliography, I hope there are some few
copies upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tellier.</span> <i>Bibliotheca
Tellereana, sive Catalogus Librorum Bibliotheca Caroli
Mauritii Le Tellier, Archiepiscopi Ducis Remensis. Parisiis,

of Tellier faces the title-page. This is a handsome volume,
containing a numerous and well-chosen collection of
books.&mdash;&mdash;<a name="Thuanus" id="Thuanus"></a><span class="smcap">Thuanus.</span> [<span class="smcap">de Thou</span>] <i>Bibliothecæ Thuanæ Catalogus</i>,
Parisiis, 1679, 8vo. "Three particular reasons," says
Baillet, "should induce us to get possession of this
catalogue; first, the immortal glory acquired by De Thou in
writing his history, and in forming the most perfect and
select library of his age: and secondly, the abundance and
excellence of the books herein specified; and, thirdly, the
great credit of the bibliographers Du Puys and Quesnel, by
whom the catalogue was compiled." <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>,
vol. ii., p. 144, &amp;c. Morhof is equally lavish in
commendation of this collection. See his <i>Polyhist.
Literar.</i>, vol. i., 36, 211. The Books of De Thou, whose
fame will live as long as a book shall be read, were
generally in beautiful condition, with his arms stamped upon
the exterior of the binding, which was usually of Morocco;
and, from some bibliographical work (I think it is
Santander's catalogue), I learn that this binding cost the
worthy president not less than 20,000 crowns. De Thou's copy
of the editio princeps of Homer is now in the British
Museum; having been presented to this national institution
by the Rev. Dr. Cyril Jackson, who has lately resigned the
deanery of Christ Church College, Oxford,&mdash;"and who is now
wisely gone to enjoy the evening of life in repose,
sweetened by the remembrance of having spent the day in
useful and strenuous exertion." For an account of the
posterior fate of De Thou's library, consult the article
"<a href="#Soubise"><span class="smcap">Soubise</span></a>," ante. I should add that, according to the <i>Bibl.
Solgeriana</i>, vol. iii., p. 243, n<span class="super">o</span>. 1431, there are
copies of this catalogue upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Uffenbach.</span>
<i>Catalogus universalis Bibliothecæ Uffenbachinæ librorum tam

clean condition.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Valliere (duc de la).</span> <i>Catalogue des

8vo., 3 vols.&mdash;<i>Des Livres de la même Bibliothéque</i>, Paris,
1783, 6 vols. 8vo. These twelve volumes of catalogues of
this nobleman's library impress us with a grand notion of
its extent and value&mdash;perhaps never exceeded by that of any
private collection! It would seem that the Duke de la
Valliere had two sales of part of his books (of which the
two first catalogues are notifications) during his
life-time: the two latter catalogues of sales having been
put forth after his decease. Of these latter (for the former
contain nothing remarkable in them, except that there are
copies of the first on <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, in 4to.), the impression
of 1783, which was compiled by Van Praet and De Bure, is the
most distinguished for its notices of MSS. and early printed
books: and in these departments it is truly precious, being
enriched with some of the choicest books in the Gaignat
Collection. Those printed <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span> alone would form a
little library! Of the impression of 1783, which has a
portrait of the owner prefixed, there were fifty copies
printed upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, in 4to., to harmonize with the
<i>Bibliographie Instructive</i>, and <i>Gaignat's Catalogue</i>. See
<i>Bibliographical Miscell.</i>, vol. ii., 66. Twelve copies were
also printed in royal 8vo., upon fine stout <span class="smcap">vellum paper</span>; of
which the Rt. Hon. T. Grenville has a beautiful uncut copy
in six volumes. See also <i>Cat. de Loménie</i> [1797], n<span class="super">o</span>.
2666. The last publication of 1788 was put forth by Nyon
l'aîné; and although the bibliographical observations are
but few in comparison with those in the preceding catalogue,
and no index is subjoined, yet it is most carefully
executed; and presents us with such a copious collection of
French topography, and old French and Italian poetry and
romances, as never has been, and perhaps never will be,
equalled. It contains 26,537 articles. The Count D'Artois
purchased this collection "en masse;" and it is now
deposited in the "bibliothéque de l'Arsenal." See <i>Dictionn.
Bibliographique</i>, vol. iv., p. 133. It was once offered for
purchase to a gentleman of this country&mdash;highly
distinguished for his love of Virtû. Mr. Grenville has also
a similar large paper copy of this latter edition, of the
date of 1784.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Vienna.</span> <i>Codices Manuscripti Theologici.

necessary to remark that, from the preface, it would appear
to contain a ninth additional book to Lambecius's well-known
Commentaries (vide, <a href="#Page_41">p. 41</a>, ante) which Kollarius had left
unpublished at his death. The preface is well worth perusal,
as it evinces the great pains which Denis has taken; and the
noble, if not matchless, munificence of his patron&mdash;"qui
præter augustam Bibliothecæ fabricam in ipsos libros
centenis plura Rhenensium expendit millia."&mdash;This catalogue
is confined to a description of Latin, with some few notices
of Oriental Manuscripts; as the preceding work of Lambecius
and Kollarius contained an account of the Greek MSS. These
three parts, forming one volume, are closed by an excellent
index. The second volume was published in 1801. Upon the
whole, it is a noble and highly useful publication; and
places its author in the foremost rank of
bibliographers.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Volpi.</span> <i>Catalogo della Libreria de

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> You have so thoroughly animated my feelings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span> and excited my

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Alas, your zeal will most egregiously deceive you! <i>Where</i>

the private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span> collections, however choice, which contain two third
parts of the excellent works before mentioned. Patience, vigilance,
and personal activity, are your best friends in such a dilemma.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> But I will no longer attend the sale of Malvolio's busts and
statues, and gaudy books. I will fly to the Strand, or King-street:
peradventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Gently, my good Lisardo. A breast thus suddenly changed from the
cold of Nova Zembla to the warmth of the torrid zone requires to be
ruled with discretion. And yet, luckily for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Speak&mdash;are you about to announce the sale of some bibliographical

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> No; but I will line my pockets with pistoles, and who dare oppose
me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> And do you imagine that no one, but yourself, has his pockets

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> It may be so&mdash;that other linings are much warmer than my

my sword in my hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Never fear. <i>Bibliomania</i> is, of all species of insanity, the
most rational and praise-worthy. I here solemnly renounce my former
opinions, and wish my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> errors to be forgotten. I here crave pardon of
the disturbed manes of the Martins, De Bures, and Patersons, for that
flagitious act of <i>Catalogue-Burning</i>; and fondly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span> hope that the

merciful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Assuredly, Lisardo, you have my entire forgiveness: and I exult
a little in the hope that you will prove yourself to be a sincere
convert to the cause, by losing no opportunity of enriching your

chevalier, and hurrying from the country to London&mdash;from London again
to the country&mdash;seeking adventures in which your prowess may be

<p class="tp"><img src="images/cap_n.png" width="250" height="243" alt="N" title="N" class="floatl" />EVER,
surely, did two mortals set off upon any expedition with
greater glee and alacrity than did Lisardo and Philemon for the sale,
by auction, of <span class="smcap">Gonzalvo's</span> bibliographical library. The great pains
which Lysander had taken in enumerating the various foreign and
domestic writers upon Bibliography, with his occasionally animated
eulogies upon some favourite author had quite inflamed the sanguine
mind of Lisardo; who had already, in anticipation, fancied himself in
possession of every book which he had heard described. Like Homer's
high-bred courser, who</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;ere he starts, a thousand steps are lost&mdash;</p>

<p>our young bibliomaniac began to count up his volumes, arrange his
shelves, bespeak his binder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span> and revel in the luxury of a splendid
and nearly matchless collection. The distance from my house to the
scene of action being thirteen miles, Lisardo, during the first six,
had pretty nearly exhausted himself in describing the delightful
pictures which his ardent fancy had formed; and finding the
conversation beginning to flag, Philemon, with his usual good-nature
and judgment, promised to make a pleasing digression from the dry
subject of book-catalogues, by an episode with which the reader shall
be presently gratified. Having promised to assist them both, when we
arrived at Messrs. L. and S., in the Strand, with some information
relating to the prices of such books as they stood in need of, and to
the various book-collectors who attended public sales, Lisardo
expressed himself highly obliged by the promise; and, sinking quietly
into a corner of the chaise, he declared that he was now in a most apt
mood to listen attentively to Philemon's digressive chat: who
accordingly thus began.</p>

<p class="bp">"Lord Coke,"&mdash;exclaimed <span class="smcap">Philemon</span>, in a mirthful strain&mdash;"before he
ventured upon '<i>The Jurisdiction of the Courts of the Forest</i>,' wished
to 'recreate himself' with Virgil's description of 'Dido's Doe of the
Forest;'<a name="FNanchor_163_166" id="FNanchor_163_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_166" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> in order that he might 'proceed the more cheerfully'
with the task he had undertaken; and thus exchange somewhat of the
precise and technical language of the lawyer for that glowing tone of
description which woodland scenes and hunting gaieties seldom fail to
produce. Even so, my good friends (pursued Philemon), I shall make a
little digression from the confined subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span> which our attentions
have been so long directed by taking you with me, in imagination, to
the delightful abode of <span class="smcap">Orlando</span>."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_163_166" id="Footnote_163_166"></a><a href="#FNanchor_163_166">[163]</a> The quaint language of Lord Coke is well
worth quotation: "And seeing we are to treat of matters of
game, and hunting, let us (to the end we may proceed the
more chearfully) recreate ourselves with the excellent
description of Dido's Doe of the Forest wounded with a
deadly arrow sticken in her, and not impertinent to our
purpose:</p>

<p>Thus pleasantly could our sage expounder of the laws of the
realm illustrate the dry subject of which he treated!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I have heard of him: a very "<i>Helluo Librorum</i>!" Thus we only
change sides&mdash;from things to men; from books to book-collectors. Is
this digressive? Is this an episode?</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Why this abrupt interruption? If I did not know you and myself,
too, Lisardo, I should observe an obstinate silence during the
remainder of the journey. An episode, though it suspend the main
action for a while, partakes of the nature of the subject of the work.
It is an <i>appropriate</i> digression. Do pray read Dr. Blair<a name="FNanchor_164_167" id="FNanchor_164_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_167" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> upon

<p class="tbp">Orlando (continued Philemon) had from his boyhood loved books and
book-reading. His fortune was rather limited; but he made shift&mdash;after
bringing up three children, whom he lost from the ages of nineteen to
twenty-four, and which have been recently followed to their graves by
the mother that gave them birth&mdash;he made shift, notwithstanding the
expenses of their college education, and keeping up the reputation of
a truly hospitable table, to collect, from year to year, a certain
number of volumes, according to a certain sum of money appropriated
for the purchase of them; generally making himself master of the
principal contents of the first year's purchase, before the ensuing
one was placed upon his shelves. He lives in a large ancestral house;
and his library is most advantageously situated and delightfully
fitted up. Disliking such a wintry residence as Thomson has
described<a name="FNanchor_165_168" id="FNanchor_165_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_168" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>&mdash;although fond of solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span> retirement, and of Cowper's
"boundless contiguity of shade,"&mdash;he has suffered the rules of common
sense always to mingle themselves in his plans of domestic comfort;
and, from the bow-windowed extremity of his library, he sees realized,
at the distance of four hundred yards, Cæsar's gently-flowing river
<i>Arar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_166_169" id="FNanchor_166_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_169" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> in a stream which loses itself behind some low shrubs;
above which is a softly-undulating hill, covered with hazel, and
birch, and oak. To the left is an open country, intersected with
meadows and corn fields, and terminated by the blue mountains of
Malvern at the distance of thirteen miles. Yet more to the left, but
within one hundred and fifty yards of the house, and forming something
of a foreground to the landscape, are a few large and lofty elm trees,
under which many a swain has rested from his toil; many a tender vow
has been breathed; many a sabbath-afternoon<a name="FNanchor_167_170" id="FNanchor_167_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_170" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> innocently kept; and

inserted in Hearne's preface to his edition of <i>Camden's

entire; but the reader may here be informed that "shooting
with the standard, shooting with the broad arrow, shooting
at the twelve score prick, shooting at the Turk, leaping for
men, running for men, wrestling, throwing the sledge, and
pitching the bar," were suffered to be exhibited, on several

evening sun-beams throw a chequered light throughout the room, 'tis
pleasant to observe how Orlando enjoys the opening of an Aldine Greek
Classic&mdash;the ample-margined leaves of which receive a mellower tint
from the soft lustre that pervades the library. Every book, whether
opened or closed, is benefited by this due portion of light; so that
the eye, in wandering over the numerous shelves, is neither hurt by
morning glare nor evening gloom. Of colours, in his furniture, he is
very sparing: he considers white shelves, picked out with gold, as
heretical&mdash;mahogany, wainscot, black, and red, are, what he calls,
orthodox colours. He has a few busts and vases; and as his room is
very lofty, he admits above, in black and gold frames, a few portraits
of eminent literary characters; and whenever he gets a genuine
Vandyke, or Velasquez, he congratulates himself exceedingly upon his
good fortune.</p>

<p>Last year I went with my uncle to pay him our annual visit. He
appeared quite altered and shaken from the recent misfortune of losing
his wife; who had survived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span> the death of her children fifteen years;
herself dying in the sixtieth of her own age. The eyes of Orlando were
sunk deeply into his forehead, yet they retained their native
brilliancy and quickness. His cheeks were wan, and a good deal
withered. His step was cautious and infirm. When we were seated in his
comfortable library chairs, he extended his right arm towards me, and
squeezing my hand cordially within his own&mdash;"Philemon," said he, "you

to gratify your favourite passion for books. Did you ever read the

remember it."&mdash;The inscription was as follows:</p>

<p class="tbp">"Have a care," said he, on my resuming my seat&mdash;"have a care that you
do not treat such a friend ill, or convert him into a foe. For myself,
my course is well nigh run. My children have long taken their leave of
me, to go to the common parent who created, and to the Saviour who has
vouchsafed to redeem, us all; and, though the usual order of nature
has been here inverted, I bow to the fate which Heaven has allotted me
with the unqualified resignation of a Christian. My wife has also
recently left me, for a better place; and I confess that I begin to
grow desolate, and anxious to take my departure to join my family. In
my solitude, dear Philemon, I have found these (pointing to his books)
to be what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> Cicero, and Seneca, and our own countryman De Bury,<a name="FNanchor_170_173" id="FNanchor_170_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_173" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
have so eloquently and truly described them to be&mdash;our friends, our
instructors, and our comforts. Without any affectation of hard
reading, great learning, or wonderful diligence, I think I may venture
to say that I have read more valuable books than it falls to the lot
of the generality of book-collectors to read; and I would fain believe
that I have profited by my studies. Although not of the profession of
the church, you know that I have always cherished a fondness for
sacred literature; and there is hardly a good edition of the Greek
Testament, or a commentator of repute upon the Bible, foreign or
domestic, but what you will find some reference to the same in my
interleaved copy of Bishop Wilson's edition of the Holy Scriptures. A
great number of these commentators themselves are in my library, as
well as every authoritative edition of the Greek Testament, from the
Complutensian to Griesbach's. Yet do not suppose that my theological
books are equal in measure to one fourth part of those in the Imperial
library at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_171_174" id="FNanchor_171_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_174" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> My object has always been instruction and
improvement; and when these could be obtained from any writer, whether
Roman Catholic or Protestant, Arminian or Calvinistic, I have not
failed to thank him, and to respect him, too, if he has declared his
opinions with becoming diffidence and moderation. You know that
nothing so sorely grieves me as dogmatical arrogance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span> in a being who
will always be frail and capricious, let him think and act as he
please. On a Sunday evening I usually devote a few hours to my
theological studies&mdash;(if you will allow my sabbath-meditations to be
so called) and, almost every summer evening in the week, saunter
'midst yon thickets and meadows by the river side, with Collins, or
Thompson, or Cowper, in my hand. The beautiful sentiments and grand
imagery of Walter Scott are left to my in-door avocations; because I
love to read the curious books to which he refers in his notes, and
have always admired, what I find few critics have noticed, how
adroitly he has ingrafted fiction upon truth. As I thus perambulate,
with my book generally open, the villagers treat me as Sir Roger De
Coverley made his tenants treat the Spectator&mdash;by keeping at a
respectful distance&mdash;but when I shut up my volume, and direct my steps
homewards, I am always sure to find myself, before I reach my
threshold, in company with at least half a dozen gossipping and
well-meaning rustics. In other departments of reading, history and
poetry are my delight. On a rainy or snowy day, when all looks sad and
dismal without, my worthy friend and neighbour, <span class="smcap">Phormio</span>, sometimes
gives me a call&mdash;and we have a rare set-to at my old favourite
volumes&mdash;the '<i>Lectiones Memorabiles et Reconditæ</i>' of <span class="smcap">Wolfius</span><a name="FNanchor_172_175" id="FNanchor_172_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_175" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>&mdash;a
common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>place book of as many curious, extraordinary, true and false
occurrences, as ever were introduced into two ponderous folios. The
number of strange cuts in it used to amuse my dear children&mdash;whose
parent, from the remembrance of the past, still finds a pleasing
recreation in looking at them. So much, dear Philemon, for my
desultory mode of studying: improve upon it&mdash;but at all events, love
your books for the good which they may produce; provided you open them
with 'singleness of heart&mdash;' that is, a sincerity of feeling.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_172_175" id="Footnote_172_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_172_175">[172]</a> There are few men, of any literary curiosity,
who would not wish to know something of the work here
noticed; and much more than appears to be known of its
illustrious author; concerning whom we will first discourse
a little: "<span class="smcap">Johannes Wolfius</span> (says
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Melchior">Melchoir</span> Adam), the laborious compiler of the
<i>Lectionum Memorabilium et Reconditarum Centenarii</i> xvi.
(being a collection of curious pieces from more than 3000
authors&mdash;chiefly Protestant) was a civilian, a soldier, and
a statesman. He was born A.D. 1537, at Vernac, in the duchy
of Deux Ponts; of which town his father was chief
magistrate. He was bred under Sturmius at Strasbourg, under
Melancthon at Wittemberg, and under Cujas at Bruges. He
travelled much and often; particularly into France and
Burgundy, with the Dukes of Stettin, in 1467. He attended
the Elector Palatine, who came with an army to the
assistance of the French Hugonots in 1569; and, in 1571, he
conducted the corpse of his master back to Germany by sea.
After this, he was frequently employed in embassies from the
electors Palatine to England and Poland. His last patrons
were the Marquisses of Baden, who made him governor of
Mündelsheim, and gave him several beneficial grants. In
1594, Wolfius bade adieu to business and courts, and retired
to Hailbrun; where he completed his "<i>Lectiones</i>," which had
been the great employment of his life. He died May 23, A.D.
1600&mdash;the same year in which the above volumes were
published." Thus far, in part, our biographer, in his <i>Vitæ
Eruditorum cum Germanorum tum Exterorum</i>: pt. iii., p. 156,
edit. 1706. These particulars may be gleaned from Wolfius's
preface; where he speaks of his literary and diplomatic
labours with great interest and propriety. In this preface
also is related a curious story of a young man of the name
of Martin, whom Wolfius employed as an amanuensis to
transcribe from his "three thousand authors"&mdash;and who was at
first so zealously attached to the principles of the Romish
Church that he declared "he wished for no heaven where
Luther might be." The young man died a Protestant; quite
reconciled to a premature end, and in perfect good will with
Luther and his doctrine. As to Wolfius, it is impossible to
read his preface, or to cast a glance upon his works&mdash;"magno
et pene incredibili labore multisque vigiliis
elaboratum"&mdash;(as Linsius has well said, in the opening of
the admonition to the reader, prefixed to his index) without
being delighted with his liberality of disposition, and
astonished at the immensity of his labour. Each volume has
upwards of 1000 pages closely printed upon an indifferent
brown-tinted paper; which serves nevertheless to set off the
several hundreds of well executed wood cuts which the work
contains. Linsius's index, a thin folio, was published in
the year 1608: this is absolutely necessary for the
completion of a copy. As bibliographers have given but a
scanty account of this uncommon work (mentioned, however,
very properly by Mr. Nicol in his interesting preface to the
catalogue of the Duke of Roxburgh's books; and of which I
observe in the <i>Bibl. Solgeriana</i>, vol. i., n<span class="super">o</span>. 1759,
that a second edition, printed in 1672, is held in
comparatively little estimation), so biographers (if we
except Melchior Adam, the great favourite of Bayle) have
been equally silent respecting its author. Fabricius, and
the Historical Dictionary published at Caen, do not mention
him; and Moreri has but a meagre and superficial notice of
him. Wolfius's <i>Penus Artis Historicæ</i>, of which the best
edition is that of 1579, is well described in the tenth
volume of Fournier's <i>Methode pour étudier l'histoire</i>, p.
12, edit. 1772. My respect for so extraordinary a
bibliomaniac as <span class="smcap">Wolfius</span>, who was groping amongst the books
of the public libraries belonging to the several great
cities which he visited, (in his diplomatic character&mdash;vide
præf.) whilst his masters and private secretary were
probably paying their devotions to Bacchus&mdash;induces me to
treat the reader with the following impression of his
portrait.</p>

<p class="centertbp">
<img src="images/wolfius.png" width="400" height="316" alt="Wolfius" title="Wolfius" />
</p>

<p>This cut is taken from a fac-simile drawing, made by me of
the head of Wolfius as it appears at the back of the
title-page to the preceding work. The original impression is
but an indifferent one; but it presents in addition, the
body of Wolfius as far as the waist; with his right hand
clasping a book, and his left the handle of a sword. His
ponderous chain has a medallion suspended at the end. This
print, which evidently belongs to the English series, has
escaped Granger. And yet I know not whether such
intelligence should be imparted!&mdash;as the scissars may hence
go to work to deprive many a copy of these "<i>Lectiones</i>," of
their elaborately-ornamented title-pages. Forbid it, good
sense!</p>

<p class="tbp">"In a short time," continued the venerable Orlando, after a pause of

boundaries of human existence are limited, indeed!' But I have made
every necessary, and, I hope, appropriate, regulation; the greater
part of my library is bequeathed to one of the colleges in the
University of Oxford; with an injunction to put an inscription over
the collection very different from what the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> Ranzau<a name="FNanchor_174_177" id="FNanchor_174_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_177" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>

remarks not very different from what Lotichius<a name="FNanchor_175_178" id="FNanchor_175_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_178" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> indited, with his
dying breath, in his book-legacy to the learned Sambucus. I will, at

expect nothing beyond what one man of sense and of virtue, in our
relative situations, would pay to the other."</p>

<p class="tp">"So spake Orlando," said Philemon, with tears in his eyes, who, upon
looking at Lisardo and myself, found our faces covered with our
handkerchiefs, and unable to utter a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>The deliberate manner in which this recital was made&mdash;the broken
periods, and frequent pauses&mdash;filled up a great measure of our
journey; and we found that St. Paul's dome was increasing upon us in
size and distinctness, and that we had not more than three miles to
travel, when Lisardo, wishing to give a different turn to the
discourse, asked Philemon what was the cause of such extravagant sums
being now given at book-sales for certain curious and uncommon&mdash;but
certainly not highly intrinsically-valuable&mdash;publications; and whether
our ancestors, in the time of Hen. VIII. and Elizabeth, paid in
proportion for the volumes of <i>their</i> Libraries?</p>

<p>Upon Philemon's declaring himself unable to gratify his friend's
curiosity, but intimating that some assistance might probably be
derived from myself, I took up the discourse by observing that&mdash;</p>

<p class="bp">"In the infancy of printing in this country (owing to the competition
of foreigners) it would seem that our own printers (who were both
booksellers and book-binders) had suffered considerably in their
trade, by being obliged to carry their goods to a market where the
generality of purchasers were pleased with more elegantly executed
works at an inferior price. The legislature felt, as every patriotic
legislature would feel, for their injured countrymen; and,
accordingly, the statute of Richard III. was enacted,<a name="FNanchor_176_179" id="FNanchor_176_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_179" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> whereby
English printers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span> and book-binders were protected from the mischiefs,
which would otherwise have overtaken them. Thus our old friend Caxton
went to work with greater glee, and mustered up all his energies to
bring a good stock of British manufacture to the market. What he
usually sold his books for, in his life time, I have not been able to
ascertain; but, on his decease, one of his <i>Golden Legends</i> was
valued, in the churchwardens' books, at six shillings and eight
pence.<a name="FNanchor_177_180" id="FNanchor_177_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_180" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Whether this was a great or small sum I know not; but,
from the same authority we find that twenty-two pounds were given,
twelve years before, for eleven huge folios, called
'<i>Antiphoners</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_178_181" id="FNanchor_178_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_181" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> In the reign of Henry VIII. it would seem, from
a memorandum in the catalogue of the Fletewode library (if I can trust
my memory with such minutiæ) that Law-Books were sold for about ten
sheets to the groat.<a name="FNanchor_179_182" id="FNanchor_179_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_182" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> Now, in the present day,
Law-Books&mdash;con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>sidering the wretched style in which they are
published, with broken types upon milk-and-water-tinted paper&mdash;are the
dearest of all modern publications. Whether they were anciently sold
for so comparatively extravagant a sum may remain to be proved.
Certain it is that, before the middle of the sixteenth century, you
might have purchased Grafton's abridgment of Polydore Virgil's
superficial work about <i>The Invention of Things</i> for fourteen
pence;<a name="FNanchor_180_183" id="FNanchor_180_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_183" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and the same printer's book of <i>Common Prayer</i> for four
shillings. Yet if you wanted a superbly bound <i>Prymer</i>, it would have
cost you (even five and twenty years before) nearly half a
guinea.<a name="FNanchor_181_184" id="FNanchor_181_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_184" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Nor could you have purchased a decent <i>Ballad</i> much under
sixpence; and <i>Hall's Chronicle</i> would have drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> from your purse
twelve shillings;<a name="FNanchor_182_185" id="FNanchor_182_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_185" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> so that, considering the then value of specie,

"at too high and unreasonable prices," then the Lord
Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, or any of the Chief Justices of

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> All this is very just. You are now creeping towards the

<p class="bp">"Don't expect," resumed I, "any antiquarian exactness in my

this as it may, we know that Sir Ralph Sadler, at the close of the

century, we find the Earl of Peterborough enlisting among the book
champions; and giving, at the sale of Richard Smith's books in 1682,
not less than eighteen shillings and two pence for the first English
edition of his beloved <i>Godfrey of Boulogne</i>.<a name="FNanchor_185_188" id="FNanchor_185_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_188" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> In Queen Ann's

Dr. Mead, who trod closely upon their heels, cared not at what price
he purchased his <i>Editiones Principes</i>, and all the grand books which
stamped such a value upon his collection. And yet, let us look at the
priced catalogue of his library, or at that of his successor Dr.
Askew, and compare the sums <i>then</i> given for those <i>now</i> offered for
similar works!"</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_183_186" id="Footnote_183_186"></a><a href="#FNanchor_183_186">[183]</a> As a little essay, and a very curious one
too, might be written upon the history of <span class="smcap">Book-Binding</span>, I
shall not attempt in the present note satisfactorily to
supply such a desideratum; but merely communicate to the
reader a few particulars which have come across me in my
desultory researches upon the subject. Mr. Astle tells us
that the famous <i>Textus Sancti Cuthberti</i>, which was written
in the 7th century, and was formerly kept at Durham, and is
now preserved in the Cottonian library, (Nero, D. <span class="smcap">iv.</span>) was
adorned in the Saxon times by Bilfrith, a monk of Durham,
with a silver cover gilt, and precious stones. Simeon
Dunelmensis, or Turgot, as he is frequently called, tells us
that the cover of this fine MS. was ornamented "forensecis
Gemmis et Auro." "A booke of Gospelles garnished and wrought
with antique worke of silver and gilte with an image of the
crucifix with Mary and John, poiz together cccxxij oz." In
the secret Jewel House in the Tower. "A booke of gold
enameled, clasped with a rubie, having on th' one side, a
crosse of dyamounts, and vj other dyamounts, and th' other
syde a flower de luce of dyamounts, and iiij rubies with a
pendaunte of white saphires and the arms of Englande. Which
booke is garnished with small emerades and rubies hanging to
a cheyne pillar fashion set with xv knottes, everie one
conteyning iij rubies (one lacking)." <i>Archæologia</i>, vol.
xiii., 220. Although Mr. Astle has not specified the time in
which these two latter books were bound, it is probable that
they were thus gorgeously attired before the discovery of
the art of printing. What the ancient Vicars of Chalk (in
Kent) used to pay for binding their missals, according to
the original endowment settled by Haymo de Hethe in 1327
(which compelled the vicars to be at the expense of the
same&mdash;<i>Reg. Roff.</i>, p. 205), Mr. Denne has not informed us.
<i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xi., 362. But it would seem, from
Warton, that "students and monks were anciently the binders
of books;" and from their Latin entries respecting the same,
the word "conjunctio" appears to have been used for
"ligatura." <i>Hist. of Engl. Poetry</i>, vol. ii., p. 244.
Hearne, in N<span class="super">o</span>. III. of the appendix to <i>Adam de Domerham
de reb. gest. Glast.</i>, has "published a grant from Rich. de
Paston to Bromholm abbey, of twelve pence a year rent charge
on his estates to <i>keep their books in repair</i>." This I
gather from Gough's <i>Brit. Topog.</i>, vol. ii., p. 20: while
from the <i>Liber Stat. Eccl. Paulinæ</i>, Lond. MSS., f. 6, 396
(furnished me by my friend Mr. H. Ellis,<a name="FNanchor_D_189" id="FNanchor_D_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_189" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> of the British
Museum), it appears to have been anciently considered as a
part of the Sacrist's duty to bind and clasp the books:
"Sacrista curet quod <i>Libri bene ligentur et haspentur</i>," &amp;c.
In Chaucer's time, one would think that the fashionable
binding for the books of young scholars was
<i>various-coloured velvet</i>: for thus our poet describes the
library of the Oxford Scholar:</p>

<p>We have some account of the style in which Chaucer's royal
patron, Edward III., used to have his books bound; as the
following extract (also furnished me by Mr. H. Ellis) will
testify:&mdash;&mdash;"To Alice Claver, for the making of <span class="smcap">xvi</span> laces
and <span class="smcap">xvi</span> tasshels for the garnyshing of diuers of the Kings
books, ij<i>s.</i> viij<i>d.</i>&mdash;&mdash;And to Robert Boillet for blac

and dressing of a booke called the bible historial, xx<i>s.</i>"
Among the expenses entered in the Wardrobe Accompts 20th
Edw. III. I suspect that it was not 'till towards the close
of the 15th century, when the sister art of painting
directed that of engraving, that books were bound in thick
boards, with leather covering upon the same; curiously
stamped with arabesque, and other bizarre, ornaments. In the
interior of this binding, next to the leaves, there was
sometimes an excavation, in which a silver crucifix was
safely guarded by a metal door, with clasps. The exterior of
the binding had oftentimes large embossed ornaments of
silver, and sometimes of precious stones [as a note in the
Appendix to the <i>History of Leicester</i>, by Mr. Nichols, p.
102, indicates&mdash;and as Geyler himself, in his <i>Ship of
Fools</i>, entitled "<i>Navicula, sive Speculum Fatuorum</i>," edit.
1511, 4to., thus expressly declares:&mdash;"sunt qui libros
inaurunt et serica tegimenta apponunt preciosa et superba,"
sign. B. v. rev.], as well as the usual ornaments upon the
leather; and two massive clasps, with thick metalled corners
on each of the outward sides of the binding, seemed to
render a book impervious to such depredations of time as
could arise from external injury. Meantime, however the worm
was secretly engendered within the wood: and his perforating
ravages in the precious leaves of the volume gave dreadful
proof of the defectiveness of ancient binding, beautiful and
bold as it undoubtedly was! The reader is referred to an
account of a preciously bound diminutive godly book (once
belonging to Q. Elizabeth), in the first volume of my
edition of the British <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, p. 83;
for which I understand the present owner asks the sum of
160<i>l.</i> We find that in the sixteenth year of Elizabeth's
reign, she was in possession of "Oone Gospell booke covered
with tissue and garnished on th' onside with the crucifix
and the Queene's badges of silver guilt, poiz with wodde,
leaves, and all, czij. oz." <i>Archæologia</i>, vol. xiii., 221.
I am in possession of the covers of a book, bound (A.D.
1569) in thick parchment or vellum, which has the whole
length portrait of Luther on one side, and of Calvin on the
other. These portraits, which are executed with uncommon
spirit and accuracy, are encircled with a profusion of
ornamental borders of the most exquisite taste and richness.
We shall speak occasionally of more modern book-binding as
we proceed. Meanwhile, let the curious bibliomaniac glance
his eye upon the copper-plate print which faces this
concluding sentence&mdash;where he will see fac-similes of the
portraits just mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> No more! Now for my catalogue; and let me attend to my marks. But

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> I dare say he will assist us in regulating the prices we ought

<p>Upon my readily acquiescing in their demand, we leapt from the chaise
(giving orders for it to attend by three o'clock) and hurried
immediately up stairs into <span class="smcap">the auction room</span>.</p>

<p>The clock had struck twelve, and in half an hour the sale was to
begin. Not more than nine or ten gentlemen were strolling about the
room: some examining the volumes which were to be sold, and making
hieroglyphical marks thereupon, in their catalogues: some giving
commissions to the clerk who entered their names, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span> the sums they
intended staking, in a manner equally hieroglyphical. Others, again,
seemed to be casting an eye of vacancy over the whole collection; or
waiting till a book friend arrived with whom they might enter into a
little chat. You observe, my friends, said I, softly, yonder active
and keen-visaged gentleman? 'Tis <span class="smcap">Lepidus</span>. Like Magliabechi, content
with frugal fare and frugal clothing<a name="FNanchor_186_190" id="FNanchor_186_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_190" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> and preferring the riches of
a library to those of house-furniture, he is insatiable in his
bibliomaniacal appetites. "Long experience has made him sage:" and it
is not therefore without just reason that his opinions are courted,
and considered as almost oracular. You will find that he will take his
old station, commanding the right or left wing of the auctioneer; and
that he will enliven, by the gaiety and shrewdness of his remarks, the
circle that more immediately surrounds him. Some there are who will
not bid 'till Lepidus bids; and who surrender all discretion and
opinion of their own to his universal book-knowledge. The consequence
is that Lepidus can, with difficulty, make purchases for his own
library; and a thousand dexterous and happy man&#339;uvres are of
necessity obliged to be practised by him, whenever a rare or curious
book turns up. How many fine collections has this sagacious
bibliomaniac seen disposed of! Like Nestor, who preaches about the
fine fellows he remembered in his youth, Lepidus (although barely yet
in his grand climacteric!) will depicture, with moving eloquence, the
numerous precious volumes of far-famed collectors, which he has seen,
like Macbeth's witches,</p>

<p class="bp">"By no means, Philemon. I think as highly of our own as did the author
of the Aprosian library<a name="FNanchor_190_194" id="FNanchor_190_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_194" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> of the Dutch booksellers; and I love to
hear that the bibliographical labour bestowed upon a catalogue has
answered the end proposed, by sharpening the appetites of purchasers.
But the present is a different case. Mustapha might have learnt good
sense and good manners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span> from his right hand, or left hand, or
opposite, neighbour; but he is either too conceited, or too obstinate,
to have recourse to such aid. What is very remarkable, although he is
constantly declaiming against the enormous sums of money given for
books at public auctions, Mustapha doth not scruple to push the
purchaser to the last farthing of his commission; from a ready knack
which he hath acquired, by means of some magical art in his foresaid
laboratory, of deciphering the same; thus adopting in a most
extraordinary manner, the very line of conduct himself which he so
tartly censures in others."</p>

Ford, of Manchester, has been kind enough to present me with
one of the <i>six</i> copies of his last catalogue of books,
printed upon <span class="smcap">strong writing paper</span>&mdash;that I take this
opportunity of praising the contents of it,&mdash;but that his
catalogues are to be praised for the pains which he exhibits
in describing his books, and in referring to numerous
bibliographical authorities in the description. While upon
this subject, let me recommend the youthful bibliomaniac to
get possession of Mr. Edwards's catalogues, and especially
of that of 1794. If such a catalogue were but recently
published, it would be one of the pleasantest breakfast
lounges imaginable to <i>tick off</i> a few of the volumes with
the hope of possessing them at the prices therein afixed.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Was this the gentleman whose catalogue (as you shewed me)

mentioned, is coming under the hammer; and powerful indeed must be the

Sopewell abbey is his ancient sweetheart; and he is about introducing
her to his friends, by a union with her as close and as honourable as
that of wedlock. Engaged in a laborious profession (the duties of
which are faithfully performed by him) Bernardo devotes his few

<p class="tbp">"If you ask me whether Bernardo be always successful in his labours, I
should answer you, as I have told him, No: for the profit and applause
attendant upon them are not commensurate with his exertions. Moreover,
I do verily think that, in some few instances, he sacrifices his
judgment to another's whim; by a reluctance to put out the strength of
his own powers. He is also, I had almost said, the admiring slave of
Ritsonian fastidiousness; and will cry 'pish' if a <i>u</i> be put for a
<i>v</i>, or a <i>single e</i> for a <i>double one</i>: but take him fairly as he is,
and place him firmly in the bibliographical scale, and you will
acknowledge that his weight is far from being inconsiderable. He is a
respectable, and every way a praise-worthy man: and although he is
continually walking in a thick forest of black letter, and would
prefer a book printed before the year 1550, to a turtle dressed
according to the rules of Mr. Farley, yet he can ever and anon sally
forth to enjoy a stroll along the river side, with Isaac Walton<a name="FNanchor_192_196" id="FNanchor_192_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_196" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
in his hand; when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span> 'he hath his wholesome walk and merry, at his ease:

the amiable and venerable <span class="smcap">Isaac Walton's</span> <i>Complete Angler</i>:
a work the most singular of its kind, breathing the very
spirit of contentment, of quiet, and unaffected
philanthrophy, and interspersed with some beautiful relics
of poetry, old songs, and ballads." So speaks the Rev. W.
Lisle Bowles, in his edition of <i>Pope's Works</i>, vol i., p.
135. To which I add&mdash;Let me take this opportunity of
recommending Mr. Bagster's very beautiful and creditable
reprint of Sir John Hawkin's edition of Walton's amusing
little book. The plates in it are as true as they are
brilliant: and the bibliomaniac may gratify his appetite,
however voracious, by having copies of it upon paper of all
sizes. Mr. Bagster has also very recently published an
exquisite facsimile of the original edition of old Isaac.
Perhaps I ought not to call it a fac-simile, for it is, in
many respects, more beautifully executed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_193_197" id="Footnote_193_197"></a><a href="#FNanchor_193_197">[193]</a> The reader may see all this, and much more,
dressed in its ancient orthographic garb, in a proheme to
the first edition of the merry art of fishing, extracted by
Herbert in his first volume, p. 131. I have said the
"<i>merry</i>," and not the "<i>contemplative</i>," art of
fishing&mdash;because we are informed that "Yf the angler take
fyshe, surely thenne is there noo man <i>merier</i> than he is in
his spyryte!!" Yet Isaac Walton called this art, "The
<i>Contemplative</i> Man's Recreation." But a <i>book-fisherman</i>,
like myself, must not presume to reconcile such great and
contradictory authorities.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">"But see&mdash;the hammer is vibrating, at an angle of twenty-two and a
half, over a large paper priced catalogue of Major Pearson's
books!&mdash;Who is the lucky purchaser?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Quisquilius</span>:&mdash;a victim to the Bibliomania. If one single copy of a
work happen to be printed in a more particular manner than another;
and if the compositor (clever rogue) happen to have transposed or
inverted a whole sentence or page; if a plate or two, no matter of
what kind or how executed; go along with it, which is not to be found
in the remaining copies; if the paper happen to be <i>unique</i> in point
of size&mdash;whether <span class="smcap">maxima</span> or <span class="smcap">minima</span>&mdash;oh, then, thrice happy is
Quisquilius! With a well-furnished purse, the strings of which are
liberally loosened, he devotes no small portion of wealth to the
accumulation of <i>Prints</i>; and can justly boast of a collection of
which few of his contemporaries are possessed. But his walk in
book-collecting is rather limited. He seldom rambles into the
luxuriancy of old English black-letter literature; and cares still
less for a <i>variorum</i> Latin classic, stamped in the neat mintage of
the Elzevir press. Of a Greek <i>Aldus</i>, or an Italian <i>Giunta</i>, he has
never yet had the luxury to dream:&mdash;'trahit sua quemque voluptas;' and
let Quisquilius enjoy his hobby-horse, even to the riding of it to
death! But let him not harbour malevolence against supposed injuries
inflicted: let not foolish prejudices, or unmanly suspicions, rankle
in his breast: authors and book-collectors are sometimes as
enlightened as himself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span> have cultivated pursuits equally
honourable. Their profession, too, may sometimes be equally beneficial
to their fellow creatures. A few short years shall pass away, and it
will be seen who has contributed the more effectively to the public
stock of amusement and instruction. We wrap ourselves up in our own
little vanities and weaknesses, and, fancying wealth and wisdom to be
synonymous, vent our spleen against those who are resolutely striving,
under the pressure of mediocrity and domestic misfortune, to obtain an
honourable subsistence by their intellectual exertions."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> A truce to this moralizing strain. Pass we on to a short
gentleman, busily engaged yonder in looking at a number of volumes,
and occasionally conversing with two or three gentlemen from five to
ten inches taller than himself. What is his name?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rosicrusius</span> is his name; and an ardent and indefatigable book-forager
he is. Although just now busily engaged in antiquarian researches
relating to British typography, he fancies himself nevertheless deeply
interested in the discovery of every ancient book printed abroad.

except a little wicked quizzing at his <i>black-letter</i> propensities in
a celebrated North Briton Review) has been generally favourable.
Although the old maidenish particularity of Tom Hearne's genius be not
much calculated to please a bibliomaniac of lively parts, yet
Rosicrusius seems absolutely enamoured of that ancient wight; and to
be in possession of the cream of all his pieces, if we may judge from
what he has already published, and promises to publish, concerning the
same. He once had the temerity to dabble in poetry;<a name="FNanchor_197_201" id="FNanchor_197_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_201" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> but he never
could raise his head above the mists which infest the swampy ground at
the foot of Parnassus. Still he loves 'the divine art'
enthusiastically; and affects, forsooth, to have a taste in matters of
engraving and painting! Converse with him about Guercino and Albert
Durer, Berghem and Woollett, and tell him that you wish to have his
opinion about the erection of a large library, and he will 'give
tongue' to you from rise to set of sun. Wishing him prosperity in his
projected works, and all good fellows to be his friends, proceed we in
our descriptive survey."</p>

darts into the hottest of the fight, and beats down all opposition. In

occasionally a forty-eight pounder; in vain he shifts his mode of
attack&mdash;now with dagger, and now with broadsword, now in plated, and
now in quilted armour: nought avails him. In every shape and at every
onset he is discomfited. Such a champion as Atticus has perhaps never
before appeared within the arena of book-gladiators:</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>and gifted with no common powers of general scholarship, he can easily
master a knotty passage in Eschylus or Aristotle; and quote Juvenal
and Horace as readily as the junior lads at Eton quote their '<i>As in
præsenti</i>:' moreover, he can enter, with equal ardour, into a minute
discussion about the romance literature of the middle ages, and the
dry though useful philology of the German school during the 16th and
17th centuries. In the pursuit after rare, curious, and valuable
books, nothing daunts or depresses him. With a mental and bodily
constitution such as few possess, and with a perpetual succession of
new objects rising up before him, he seems hardly ever conscious of
the vicissitudes of the seasons, and equally indifferent to petty
changes in politics. The cutting blasts of Siberia, or the fainting
heat of a Maltese sirocco, would not make him halt, or divert his
course, in the pursuit of a favourite volume, whether in the Greek,
Latin, Spanish, or Italian language. But as all human efforts, however
powerful, if carried on without intermission, must have a period of
cessation; and as the most active body cannot be at 'Thebes and at
Athens' at the same moment; so it follows that Atticus cannot be at
every auction and carry away every prize. His rivals narrowly watch,
and his enemies closely way-lay, him; and his victories are rarely
bloodless in consequence. If, like Darwin's whale, which swallows
'millions at a gulp,' Atticus should, at one auction, purchase from
two to seven hundred volumes, he must retire, like the '<i>Boa
Constrictor</i>,' for digestion: and accordingly he does, for a short
season, withdraw himself from 'the busy hum' of sale rooms, to
collate, methodize, and class his newly acquired treasures&mdash;to repair
what is defective, and to beautify what is deformed. Thus rendering
them 'companions meet' for their brethren in the rural shades of H&mdash;&mdash;
Hall; where, in gay succession, stands many a row, heavily laden with
'rich and rare' productions. In this rural retreat, or academic bower,
Atticus spends a due portion of the autumnal season of the year; now
that the busy scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span> of book-auctions in the metropolis have changed
their character&mdash;and dreary silence, and stagnant dirt, have succeeded
to noise and flying particles of learned dust.</p>

err. He has now and then an ungovernable passion to possess more
copies of a book than there were ever parties to a deed, or stamina to
a plant: and therefore I cannot call him a duplicate or triplicate
collector. His best friends scold&mdash;his most respectable rivals
censure&mdash;and a whole 'mob of gentlemen' who think to collect 'with
ease,' threaten vengeance against&mdash;him, for this despotic spirit which
he evinces; and which I fear nothing can stay or modify but an act of
parliament that no gentleman shall purchase more than two copies of a
work; one for his town, the other for his country, residence."</p>

<p>"Most completely so, Philemon. This is the 'pars melior' of every book
collector, and it is indeed the better part with Atticus. The learned
and curious, whether rich or poor, have always free access to his
library&mdash;</p>

water, as are those of <span class="smcap">Pontevallo's</span>; but like a thousand rills, which
run down from the lake on Snowdon's summit, after a plentiful fall of
rain, they serve to fertilize and adorn every thing to which they
extend. In consequence, he sees himself reflected in a thousand
mirrors: and has a right to be vain of the numerous dedications to
him, and of the richly ornamented robes in which he is attired by his
grateful friends."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Long life to Atticus, and to all such book heroes! Now pray
inform me who is yonder gentleman, of majestic mien and shape?&mdash;and
who strikes a stranger with as much interest as Agamemnon did
Priam&mdash;when the Grecian troops passed at a distance in order of
review, while the Trojan monarch and Helen were gossipping with each
other on the battlements of Troy!</p>

<p>"That gentleman, Lisardo, is <span class="smcap">Hortensius</span>; who, you see is in close
conversation with an intimate friend and fellow-bibliomaniac&mdash;that
ycleped is <span class="smcap">Ulpian</span>. They are both honourable members of an honourable
profession; and although they have formerly sworn to purchase no old
book but Machlinia's first edition of Littleton's Tenures, yet they
cannot resist, now and then, the delicious impulse of becoming masters
of a black-letter chronicle or romance. Taste and talent of various
kind they both possess; and 'tis truly pleasant to see gentlemen and
scholars, engaged in a laborious profession, in which, comparatively,
'little vegetation quickens, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span> few salutary plants take root,'
finding 'a pleasant grove for their wits to walk in' amidst rows of
beautifully bound, and intrinsically precious, volumes. They feel it
delectable, 'from the loop-holes of such a retreat,' to peep at the
multifarious pursuits of their brethren; and while they discover some
busied in a perversion of book-taste, and others preferring the
short-lived pleasures of sensual gratifications&mdash;which must 'not be
named' among good bibliomaniacs&mdash;they can sit comfortably by their
fire-sides; and, pointing to a well-furnished library, say to their
wives&mdash;who heartily sympathize in the sentiment&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis <span class="smcap">Leontes</span>: a man of taste, and an accomplished antiquary. Even yet
he continues to gratify his favourite passion for book and
print-collecting; although his library is at once choice and copious,
and his collection of prints exquisitely fine. He yet enjoys, in the
evening of life, all that unruffled temper and gentlemanly address
which delighted so much in his younger days, and which will always
render him, in his latter years, equally interesting and admired. Like
Atticus, he is liberal in the loan of his treasures; and, as with him,
so 'tis with Leontes&mdash;the spirit of book-collecting 'assumes the

world await him beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> grave! His memory will always be held in
reverence by honest bibliomaniacs; and a due sense of his kindness
towards myself shall constantly be impressed upon me&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Amen. With Leontes I suppose you close your account of the most
notorious bibliomaniacs who generally attend book sales in person; for
I observe no other person who mingles with those already
described&mdash;unless indeed, three very active young ones, who
occasionally converse with each other, and now and then have their
names affixed to some very expensive purchases&mdash;</p>

<p>"They are the three <span class="smcap">Mercurii</span>, oftentimes deputed by distinguished
bibliomaniacs: who, fearful of the sharp-shooting powers of their
adversaries, if they <i>themselves</i> should appear in the ranks, like
prudent generals, keep aloof. But their aides-de-camp are not always
successful in their missions; for such is the obstinacy with which
book-battles are now contested, that it requires three times the
number of guns and weight of metal to accomplish a particular object
to what it did when John Duke of Marlborough wore his full-bottomed
periwig at the battle of Blenheim.</p>

<p>"Others there are, again, who employ these Mercurii from their own
inability to attend in person, owing to distance, want of time, and
other similar causes. Hence, many a desperate bibliomaniac keeps in
the back-ground; while the public are wholly unacquainted with his
curious and rapidly-increasing treasures. Hence <span class="smcap">Sir Tristram</span>,

potent as the witches' cauldron in Macbeth) he gives the world many a
wondrous-sweet song. Who that has read the exquisite poems, of the
fame of which all Britain 'rings from side to side,' shall deny to
such ancient legends a power to charm and instruct? Or who, that
possesses a copy of <span class="smcap">Prospero's</span> excellent volumes, although composed in
a different strain (yet still more fruitful in ancient matters), shall
not love the memory and exalt the renown of such transcendent
bibliomaniacs? The library of Prospero is indeed acknowledged to be
without a rival in its way. How pleasant it is, dear Philemon, only to
contemplate such a goodly prospect of elegantly bound volumes of old
English and French literature!&mdash;and to think of the matchless stores
which they contain, relating to our ancient popular tales and romantic
legends!</p>

<p class="tp">"Allied to this library, in the general complexion of its literary
treasures, is that of <span class="smcap">Marcellus</span>: while in the possession of numberless
rare and precious volumes relating to the drama, and especially to his
beloved Shakespeare, it must be acknowledged that Marcellus hath
somewhat the superiority. Meritorious as have been his labours in the
illustration of our immortal bard, he is yet as zealous, vigilant, and
anxious, as ever, to accumulate every thing which may tend to the
further illustration of him. Enter his book-cabinet; and with the
sight of how many <i>unique</i> pieces and tracts are your ardent eyes
blessed! Just so it is with <span class="smcap">Aurelius</span>! He also, with the three last
mentioned bibliomaniacs, keeps up a constant fire at book auctions;
although he is not personally seen in securing the spoils which he
makes. Unparalleled as an antiquary in Caledonian history and poetry,
and passionately attached to every thing connected with the fate of
the lamented Mary, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span> with that of the great poetical
contemporaries, Spenser and Shakespeare, Aurelius is indefatigable in
the pursuit of such ancient lore as may add value to the stores,
however precious, which he possesses. His <i>Noctes Atticæ</i>, devoted to
the elucidation of the history of his native country, will erect to
his memory a splendid and imperishable monument. These, my dear
friends, these are the virtuous and useful, and therefore salutary
ends of book-collecting and book-reading. Such characters are among
the proudest pillars that adorn the greatest nations upon earth.</p>

<p>"Let me, however, not forget to mention that there are bashful or busy
bibliomaniacs, who keep aloof from book-sales, intent only upon
securing, by means of these Mercurii, <i>stainless</i> or <i>large paper</i>
copies of ancient literature. While <span class="smcap">Menalcas</span> sees his oblong cabinet
decorated with such a tall, well-dressed, and perhaps matchless,
regiment of <i>Variorum Classics</i>, he has little or no occasion to
regret his unavoidable absence from the field of battle, in the Strand
or Pall Mall. And yet&mdash;although he is environed with a body guard, of
which the great Frederick's father might have envied him the
possession, he cannot help casting a wishful eye, now and then, upon
still choicer and taller troops which he sees in the territories of
his rivals. I do not know whether he would not sacrifice the whole
right wing of his army, for the securing of some magnificent treasures
in the empire of his neighbour <span class="smcap">Rinaldo</span>: for there he sees, and adores,
with the rapture-speaking eye of a classical bibliomaniac, the tall,
wide, thick, clean, brilliant, and illuminated copy of the <i>first
Livy</i> <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>&mdash;enshrined in an impenetrable oaken case, covered
with choice morocco!</p>

<p>"There he often witnesses the adoration paid to this glorious object,
by some bookish pilgrim, who, as the evening sun reposes softly upon
the hill, pushes onward, through copse, wood, moor, heath, bramble,
and thicket, to feast his eyes upon the mellow lustre of its leaves,
and upon the nice execution of its typography. Menalcas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span> sees all
this; and yet has too noble a heart to envy Rinaldo his treasures!
These bibliomaniacs often meet and view their respective forces; but
never with hostile eyes. They know their relative strength; and wisely
console themselves by being each 'eminent in his degree.' Like
Corregio, they are 'also painters' in their way."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> A well-a-day, Lisardo! Does not this recital chill your blood
with despair? Instead of making your purchases, you are only listening
supinely to our friend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Not exactly so. One of these obliging Mercurii has already
executed a few commissions for me. You forget that our friend entered
into a little chat with him, just before we took possession of our
seats. As to despair of obtaining book-gems similar to those of the
four last mentioned bibliomaniacs, I know not what to say&mdash;yet this I
think must be granted: no one could make a better use of them than
their present owners. See, the elder Mercurius comes to tell me of a
pleasant acquisition to my library! What a murmur and confusion
prevail about the auctioneer! Good news, I trust?</p>

<p class="bp">At this moment Lisardo received intelligence that he had obtained
possession of the catalogues of the books of Bunau, Crevenna, and
Pinelli; and that, after a desperate struggle with <span class="smcap">Quisquilius</span>, he
came off victorious in a contest for De Bure's <i>Bibliographie
Instructive</i>, <i>Gaignat's Catalogue</i>, and the two copious ones of the
<i>Duke de la Valliere</i>: these four latter being half-bound and uncut,
in nineteen volumes. Transport lit up the countenance of Lisardo, upon
his receiving this intelligence; but as pleasure and pain go hand in
hand in this world, so did this young and unsuspecting bibliomaniac
evince heavy affliction, on being told that he had failed in his
attack upon the best editions of Le Long's <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>,
Fresnoy's <i>Méthode pour etudier l'Histoire</i>, and Baillet's <i>Jugemens
des Savans</i>&mdash;these having been carried off, at the point of the
bayonet, by an irresistible onset from <span class="smcap">Atticus</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span> "Remember, my
friend," said I, in a soothing strain, "remember that you are but a
Polydore; and must expect to fall when you encounter Achilles.<a name="FNanchor_209_213" id="FNanchor_209_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_213" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
Think of the honour you have acquired in this day's glorious contest;
and, when you are drenching your cups of claret, at your hospitable
board, contemplate your De Bure as a trophy which will always make you
respected by your visitors! I am glad to see you revive. Yet further
intelligence?"</p>

this beautiful youth, by the merciless Achilles, from the
407 to 418th verso of the xxth book of <i>Homer's Iliad</i>.
Fortunately for Lisardo, he survives the contest, and even
threatens revenge.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> My good Mercurius, for whom a knife and fork shall always be laid
at my table, has just informed me that Clement's <i>Bibliotheque
Curieuse</i>, and Panzer's <i>Typographical Annals</i>, are knocked down to
me, after Mustapha had picked me out for single combat, and battered
my breast-plate with a thousand furious strokes!</p>

<p>"You must always," said I, "expect tough work from such an enemy, who
is frequently both wanton and wild. But I congratulate you heartily on
the event of this day's contest. Let us now pack up and pay for our
treasures. Your servant has just entered the room, and the chaise is
most probably at the door."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I am perfectly ready. Mercurius tells me that the whole amounts
to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Upwards of thirty guineas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Hard upon forty pounds. Here is the draft upon my banker: and
then for my precious tomes of bibliography! A thousand thanks, my
friend. I love this place of all things; and, after your minute
account of the characters of those who frequent it, I feel a strong
propensity to become a deserving member of so respectable a
fraternity. Leaving them all to return to their homes as satisfied as
myself, I wish them a hearty good day.</p>

<p>Upon saying this, we followed Lisardo and his biblio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>graphical
treasures into the chaise; and instantly set off, at a sharp trot, for
the quiet and comfort of green fields and running streams. As we
rolled over Westminster-bridge, we bade farewell, like the historian

the first seven miles of our return from the busy scene which
has just been described, it was sufficiently obvious that Lisardo was
suffering a little under the pangs of mortification. True it was, he
had filled his pocket with an ampler supply of pistoles than it ever
fell to the lot of Gil Blas, at the same time of life, to be master
of; but he had not calculated upon the similar condition of his
competitors; some of whom had yet greater powers of purchase, and a
more resolute determination, as well as nicer skill, in exercising
these powers, than himself. Thus rushing into the combat with the heat
and vehemence of youth, he was of necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span> compelled to experience
the disappointment attendant upon such precipitancy. It was in vain
that Philemon and myself endeavoured to make him completely satisfied
with his purchase: nothing produced a look of complacency from him. At
length, upon seeing the rising ground which was within two or three
miles of our respective homes, he cheered up by degrees; and a sudden
thought of the treasures contained in his Clement, De Bure and Panzer,
darted a gleam of satisfaction across his countenance. His eyes
resumed their wonted brilliancy, and all the natural gaiety of his
disposition returned with full effect to banish every vapour of
melancholy. "Indeed, my good friend," said he to me&mdash;"I shall always
have reason to think and speak well of your kindness shewn towards me
this day; and although some years may elapse before a similar
collection may be disposed of&mdash;and I must necessarily wait a tedious
period 'ere I get possession of Maittaire, Audiffredi, and others of
the old school&mdash;yet I hope to convince Lysander, on the exhibition of
my purchase, that my conversion to bibliography has been sincere. Yes:
I perceive that I have food enough to digest, in the volumes which are
now my travelling companions, for two or three years to come&mdash;and if,
by keeping a sharp look-out upon booksellers' catalogues when they are
first published, I can catch hold of Vogt, Schelhorn and Heinecken, my
progress in bibliography, within the same period, must be downright
marvellous!" "I congratulate you," exclaimed <span class="smcap">Philemon</span>, "upon the
return of your reason and good sense. I began to think that the story
of Orlando had been thrown away upon you; and that his regular yearly
purchases of a certain set of books, and making himself master of
their principal contents before he ventured upon another similar
purchase, had already been banished from your recollection."</p>

<p>We were now fast approaching the end of our journey; when the groom of
Lorenzo, mounted upon a well-bred courser, darted quickly by the
chaise, ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>parently making towards my house&mdash;but on turning his head,
and perceiving me within it, he drew up and bade the postilion stop. A
note from his master soon disclosed the reason of this interruption.
<span class="smcap">Lorenzo</span>, upon hearing of the arrival of Lysander and Philemon, and of
their wish to visit his library, had sent us all three a kind
invitation to dine with him on the morrow. His close intimacy with
Lisardo (who was his neighbour) had left no doubt in the mind of the
latter but that a similar note had been sent to his own house. After
telling the messenger that we would not fail to pay our respects to
his master, we drove briskly homewards; and found Lysander sitting on
a stile under some wide-spreading beech trees, at the entrance of the
paddock, expecting our arrival. In less than half an hour we sat down
to dinner (at a time greatly beyond what I was accustomed to);
regaling Lysander, during the repast, with an account of the contest
we had witnessed; and every now and then preventing Lisardo from
rushing towards his packet (even in the midst of his <i>fricandeau</i>),
and displaying his book-treasures. After dinner, our discussion
assumed a more methodical shape. Lysander bestowed his hearty
commendations upon the purchase; and, in order to whet the
bibliomaniacal appetite of his young convert, he slyly observed that
his set of De Bure's pieces were <i>half bound</i> and <i>uncut</i>; and that by
having them bound in morocco, with gilt leaves, he would excel my own
set; which latter was coated in a prettily-sprinkled calf leather,
with speckled edges. Lisardo could not repress the joyful sensations
which this remark excited; and I observed that, whenever his eyes
glanced upon my shelves, he afterwards returned them upon his own
little collection, with a look of complacency mingled with exultation.
It was evident, therefore, that he was now thoroughly reconciled to
his fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> During your absence, I have been reading a very favourite work
of mine&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dr. Henry's</span> <i>History of Great Britain</i>; especially that part
of it which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span> prefer so much to the history of human cunning and
human slaughter; I mean, the account of learning and of learned men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> It is also a great favourite with me. But while I regret the
inexcuseable omission of an index to such a voluminous work, and the
inequality of Mr. Andrews's partial continuation of it, I must be
permitted to observe that the history of our literature and learned
men is not the most brilliant, or best executed, part of Dr. Henry's
valuable labours. There are many omissions to supply, and much
interesting additional matter to bring forward, even in some of the
most elaborate parts of it. His account of the arts might also be
improved; although in commerce, manners and customs, I think he has
done as much, and as well, as could reasonably be expected. I
question, however, whether his work, from the plan upon which it is
executed, will ever become so popular as its fondest admirers seem to
hope.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You are to consider, Philemon, that in the execution of such
an important whole, in the erection of so immense a fabric, some parts
must necessarily be finished in a less workman-like style than others.
And, after all, there is a good deal of caprice in our criticisms. You
fancy, in this fabric (if I may be allowed to go on with my simile), a
boudoir, a hall, or a staircase; and fix a critical eye upon a recess
badly contrived, an oval badly turned, or pillars weakly put
together:&mdash;the builder says, Don't look at these parts of the fabric
with such fastidious nicety; they are subordinate. If my boudoir will
hold a moderate collection of old-fashioned Dresden China, if my
staircase be stout enough to conduct you and your company to the upper
rooms; and, if my hall be spacious enough to hold the hats, umbrellas
and walking-sticks of your largest dinner-party, they answer the ends
proposed:&mdash;unless you would <i>live</i> in your boudoir, upon your
staircase, or within your hall! The fact then is, you, Philemon,
prefer the boudoir, and might, perhaps, im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>prove upon its structure;
but, recollect, there are places in a house of equal, or perhaps more,
consequence than this beloved boudoir. Now, to make the obvious
application to the work which has given rise to this wonderful stretch
of imagination on my part:&mdash;Dr. Henry is the builder, and his history
is the building, in question: in the latter he had to put together,
with skill and credit, a number of weighty parts, of which the "<i>Civil
and Ecclesiastical</i>" is undoubtedly the most important to the
generality of readers. But one of these component parts was the <i>The
History of Learning and of Learned Men</i>; which its author probably
thought of subordinate consequence, or in the management of which, to
allow you the full force of your objection, he was not so well
skilled. Yet, still, never before having been thus connected with such
a building, it was undoubtedly a delightful acquisition; and I
question whether, if it had been more elaborately executed&mdash;if it had
exhibited all the fret-work and sparkling points which you seem to
conceive necessary to its completion; I question, whether the
popularity of the work would have been even so great as it is, and as
it unquestionably merits to be! A few passionately-smitten literary
antiquaries are not, perhaps, the fittest judges of such a production.
To be generally useful and profitable should be the object of every
author of a similar publication; and as far as candour and liberality
of sentiment, an unaffected and manly style, accompanied with weighty
matter, extensive research, and faithful quotation, render a work
nationally valuable&mdash;the work of Dr. Henry, on these grounds, is an
ornament and honour to his country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Yet I wish he had rambled (if you will permit me so to speak) a
little more into book-men and book-anecdotes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You may indulge this wish very innocently; but, certainly, you
ought not to censure Dr. Henry for the omission of such minutiæ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Does he ever quote Clement, De Bure, or Panzer?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Away with such bibliomaniacal frenzy! He quotes solid, useful
and respectable authorities; chiefly our old and most valuable
historians. No writer before him ever did them so much justice, or
displayed a more familiar acquaintance with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Do pray give us, Lysander, some little sketches of
book-characters&mdash;which, I admit, did not enter into the plan of Dr.
Henry's excellent work. As I possess the original quarto edition of
this latter, bound in Russia, you will not censure me for a want of
respect towards the author.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> I second Lisardo's motion; although I fear the evening presses
too hard upon us to admit of much present discussion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Nothing&mdash;(speaking most unaffectedly from my heart) nothing
affords me sincerer pleasure than to do any thing in my power which
may please such cordial friends as yourselves. My pretensions to that
sort of antiquarian <i>knowledge</i>, which belongs to the history of
book-collectors, are very poor, as you well know,&mdash;they being greatly
eclipsed by my <i>zeal</i> in the same cause. But, as I love my country and
my country's literature, so no conversation or research affords me a
livelier pleasure than that which leads me to become better acquainted
with the ages which have gone by; with the great and good men of old;
who have found the most imperishable monuments of their fame in the
sympathizing hearts of their successors. But I am wandering&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Go on as you please, dear Lysander; for I have been too much
indebted to your conversation ever to suppose it could diverge into
any thing censoriously irrelevant. Begin where and when you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I assure you it is far from my intention to make any formal
exordium, even if I knew the exact object of your request.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Tell us all about book-collecting and <span class="smcap">Bibliomaniacs</span> in this

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> In sober truth, you impose upon me a pretty tough task! "One
Thousand and One Nights" would hardly suffice for the execution of it;
and now, already, I see the owl flying across the lawn to take her
station in the neighbouring oak; while even the middle ground of
yonder landscape is veiled in the blue haziness of evening. Come a
short half hour, and who, unless the moon befriend him, can see the
outline of the village church? Thus gradually and imperceptibly, but
thus surely, succeeds age to youth&mdash;death to life&mdash;eternity to
time!&mdash;You see in what sort of mood I am for the performance of my
promise?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Reserve these meditations for your pillow, dear Lysander: and
now, again I entreat you&mdash;"commençez au commençement."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Pray make a beginning only: the conclusion shall be reserved, as
a desert, for Lorenzo's dinner to-morrow.</p>

have already done; and endeavour to say something which may gratify
you as before.</p>

<p class="bp">It has often struck me my dear friends, continued Lysander&mdash;(in a
balanced attitude, and seeming to bring quietly together all his
scattered thoughts upon the subject) it has often struck me that few
things have operated more unfavourably towards the encouragement of
learning, and of book-collecting, than the universal passion for
<i>chivalry</i>&mdash;which obtained towards the middle ages; while, on the
other hand, a <i>monastic life</i> seems to have excited a love of
retirement, meditation, and reading.<a name="FNanchor_210_214" id="FNanchor_210_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_214" class="fnanchor">[210]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span> I admit readily, that,
considering the long continuance of the monastic orders, and that
almost all intellectual improvement was confined within the cloister,
a very slow and partial progress was made in literature. The system of
education was a poor, stinted, and unproductive one. Nor was it till
after the enterprising activity of Poggio had succeeded in securing a
few precious remains of classical antiquity,<a name="FNanchor_211_215" id="FNanchor_211_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_215" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> that the wretched
indolence of the monastic life began to be diverted from a constant
meditation upon "antiphoners, grailes, and psalters,"<a name="FNanchor_212_216" id="FNanchor_212_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_216" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> towards
subjects of a more generally interesting nature. I am willing to admit
every degree of merit to the manual dexterity of the cloistered
student. I admire his snow-white vellum missals, emblazoned with gold,
and sparkling with carmine and ultramarine blue. By the help of the
microscopic glass, I peruse his diminutive penmanship, executed with
the most astonishing neatness and regularity; and often wish in my
heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span> that our typographers printed with ink as glossy black as that
which they sometimes used in their writing. I admire all this; and now
and then, for a guinea or two, I purchase a specimen of such
marvellous leger-de-main: but the book, when purchased, is to me a
sealed book. And yet, Philemon, I blame not the individual, but the
age; not the task, but the task-master; for surely the same exquisite
and unrivalled beauty would have been exhibited in copying an ode of
Horace, or a dictum of Quintilian. Still, however, you may say that
the intention, in all this, was pure and meritorious; for that such a
system excited insensibly a love of quiet, domestic order, and
seriousness: while those counsels and regulations which punished a
"Clerk for being a hunter," and restricted "the intercourse of
Concubines,"<a name="FNanchor_213_217" id="FNanchor_213_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_217" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> evinced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span> spirit of jurisprudence which would have
done justice to any age. Let us allow, then, if you please, that a
love of book-reading, and of book-collecting, was a meritorious trait
in the monastic life; and that we are to look upon old abbies and
convents as the sacred depositories of the literature of past ages.
What can you say in defence of your times of beloved chivalry?</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_210_214" id="Footnote_210_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_210_214">[210]</a> As early as the sixth century commenced the
custom, in some monasteries, of copying ancient books and
composing new ones. It was the usual, and even only,
employment of the first monks of Marmoutier. A monastery
without a library was considered as a fort or a camp
deprived of the necessary articles for its defence:
"claustrum sine armario, quasi castrum sine armentario."
Peignot, <i>Dict. de Bibliolog.</i>, vol. i., 77. I am fearful
that this good old bibliomanical custom of keeping up the
credit of their libraries among the monks had ceased&mdash;at
least in the convent of Romsey, in Hampshire&mdash;towards the
commencement of the sixteenth century. One would think that
the books had been there disposed of in bartering for
<i>strong liquors</i>; for at a visitation by Bishop Fox, held
there in 1506, Joyce Rows, the abbess, is accused of
<i>immoderate drinking</i>, especially in the night time; and of
inviting the nuns to her chamber every evening, for the
purpose of these excesses, "post completorium." What is
frightful to add,&mdash;"this was a rich convent, and filled with
ladies of the best families." See Warton's cruel note in his
<i>Life of Sir Thomas Pope</i>, p. 25, edit. 1772. A
tender-hearted bibliomaniac cannot but feel acutely on
reflecting upon the many beautifully-illuminated vellum
books which were, in all probability, exchanged for these
inebriating gratifications! To balance this unfavourable
account read Hearne's remark about the libraries in ancient
monasteries, in the sixth volume of <i>Leland's Collectanea</i>,
p. 86-7, edit. 1774: and especially the anecdotes and
authorities stated by Dr. Henry in book iii., chap, iv.,

aventurous knights should just against all comers, the which
should find them there the first day of the lusty month of

should just three days in three colours: that is to wit, in
black, grey and violet&mdash;and their shields of the same hue;
and them to find on the third day at the lists. There justed
divers young knights of the king's court: and the justing
was more <i>asperer</i> of those young knights than ever they had
seen any in that country. And, by the report of the ladies,
they did so knightly, every one, that it was not possible
for to do better, as them thought, by their strokes. But,
above all other, <span class="smcap">Oliver</span> and <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> (his loyal fellow) had
the <i>bruit</i> and <i>loos</i>. The justing endured long: it was
marvel to see the hideous strokes that they dealt; for the
justing had not finished so soon but that the night
<i>separed</i> them. Nevertheless, the adversary party abode
'till the torches were light. But the ladies and
<i>damoyselles</i>, that of all the justing time had been there,
were weary, and would depart. Wherefore the justers departed
in likewise, and went and disarmed them for to come to the
banquet or feast. And when that the banquet was finished and
done, the dances began. And there came the king and the
valiant knights of arms, for to enquire of the ladies and
<i>damoyselles</i>, who that had best borne him as for that day.
The ladies, which were all of one accord and agreement, said
that Oliver and Arthur had surmounted all the best doers of
that <i>journey</i>. And by cause that Oliver and Arthur were
both of one party, and that they could find but little
difference between them of knighthood, they knew not the
which they might sustain. But, in the end, they said that
Arthur had done right valiantly: nevertheless, they said
that Oliver had done best unto their seeming. And therefore
it was concluded that the <i>pryce</i> should be given unto
Oliver, as for the best of them of within. And another noble
knight, of the realm of Algarbe, that came with the queen,
had the pryce of without. When the pryce of the juste that
had been made was brought before Oliver, by two fair
<i>damoyselles</i>, he waxed all red, and was ashamed at that
present time; and said that it was of their bounty for to
give him the pryce, and not of his desert: nevertheless, he
received it; and, as it was of custom in guerdoning them, he
kissed them. And soon after they brought the wine and
spices; and then the dances and the feast took an end as for
that night." <i>Hystorye of Olyuer of Castylle, and of the

the room to examine thoroughly his newly-purchased volumes, and
Lysander took down a prettily executed 8vo. volume upon the Game of

amateur." While we were examining, in this neat work, an account of
the numerous publications upon the Game of Chess, in various countries

about eminent chess players, Lisardo was carefully packing up his
books, as he expected his servant every minute to take them away. The
servant shortly arrived, and upon his expressing his inability to
carry the entire packet&mdash;"Here," exclaimed Lisardo, "do you take the
quartos, and follow me; who will march onward with the octavos." This
was no sooner said than our young bibliomaniacal convert gave De Bure,
Gaignat, and La Valliere, a vigorous swing across his shoulders; while
the twenty quarto volumes of Clement and Panzer were piled, like "Ossa
upon Pelion," upon those of his servant&mdash;and</p>

<p class="center">"Light of foot, and light of heart"</p>

<p>Lisardo took leave of us 'till the morrow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the chess combat continued with unabated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span> spirit. Here
Philemon's king stood pretty firmly guarded by both his knights, one
castle, one bishop, and a body of common soldiers<a name="FNanchor_218_222" id="FNanchor_218_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_222" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>&mdash;impenetrable
as the Grecian phalanx, or Roman legion; while his queen had made a
sly sortie to surprise the only surviving knight of Narcottus.
Narcottus, on the other hand, was cautiously collecting his scattered
foot soldiers, and, with two bishops, and two castle-armed elephants,
were meditating a desperate onset to retrieve the disgrace of his lost
queen. An inadvertent remark from Lysander, concerning the antiquity
of the game, attracted the attention of Philemon so much as to throw
him off his guard; while his queen, forgetful of her sex, and
venturing unprotected, like Penthesilea of old, into the thickest of
the fight, was trampled under foot, without mercy,<a name="FNanchor_219_223" id="FNanchor_219_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_223" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> by a huge
elephant, carrying a castle of armed men upon his back. Shouts of
applause, from Narcottus's men, rent the vaulted air; while grief and
consternation possessed the astonished army of Philemon. "Away with
your antiquarian questions," exclaimed the latter, looking sharply at
Lysander: "away with your old editions of the Game of Chess! The
moment is critical; and I fear the day may be lost. Now for desperate
action!" So saying, he bade the King exhort his dismayed subjects. His
Majesty made a spirited oration; and called upon <i>Sir Launcelot</i>, the
most distinguished of the two Knights,<a name="FNanchor_220_224" id="FNanchor_220_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_224" class="fnanchor">[220]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span> to be mindful of his own
and of his country's honour: to spare the effusion of blood among his
subjects as much as possible; but rather to place victory or defeat in
the comparative skill of the officers: and, at all events, to rally
round that throne which had conferred such high marks of distinction
upon his ancestors. "I needed not, gracious sire," replied Sir
Launcelot&mdash;curbing in his mouth-foaming steed, and fixing his spear in
the rest&mdash;"I needed not to be here reminded of your kindness to my
forefathers, or of the necessity of doing every thing, at such a
crisis, beseeming the honour of a true round-table knight.&mdash;Yes,
gracious sovereign, I swear to you by the love I bear to <span class="smcap">the Lady of
the Lake</span><a name="FNanchor_221_225" id="FNanchor_221_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_225" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>&mdash;by the remembrance of the soft moments we have passed
together in the honey-suckle bowers of her father&mdash;by all that an
knight of chivalry is taught to believe the most sacred and binding&mdash;I
swear that I will not return this day alive without the laurel of
victory entwined round my brow. Right well do I perceive that deeds
and not words must save us now&mdash;let the issue of the combat prove my
valour and allegiance." Upon this, Sir Launcelot clapped spurs to his
horse, and after driving an unprotected Bishop into the midst of the
foot-soldiers, who quickly took him prisoner, he sprang forward, with
a lion-like nimbleness and ferocity, to pick out <i>Sir Galaad</i>, the
only remaining knight in the adverse army, to single combat. Sir
Galaad, strong and wary, like the Greenland bear when assailed by the
darts and bullets of our whale-fishing men, marked the fury of Sir
Launcelot's course, and sought rather to present a formidable defence
by calling to aid his elephants, than to meet such a champion
single-handed. A shrill blast from his horn told the danger of his
situation, and the necessity of help. What should now be done? The
unbroken ranks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> Philemon's men presented a fearful front to the
advance of the elephants, and the recent capture of a venerable bishop
had made the monarch, on Narcottus's side, justly fearful of risking
the safety of his empire by leaving himself wholly without episcopal
aid. Meanwhile the progress of Sir Launcelot was marked with blood;
and he was of necessity compelled to slaughter a host of common men,
who stood thickly around Sir Galaad, resolved to conquer or die by his
side. At length, as Master Laneham aptly expresses it, "get they
grysly together."<a name="FNanchor_222_226" id="FNanchor_222_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_226" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The hostile leaders met; there was neither time
nor disposition for parley. Sir Galaad threw his javelin with
well-directed fury; which, flying within an hair's breadth of Sir
Launcelot's shoulder, passed onward, and, grazing the cheek of a foot
soldier, stood quivering in the sand. He then was about to draw his
ponderous sword&mdash;but the tremendous spear of Sir Launcelot, whizzing
strongly in the air, passed through his thickly quilted belt, and,
burying itself in his bowels, made Sir Galaad to fall breathless from
his horse. Now might you hear the shouts of victory on one side, and
the groans of the vanquished on the other; or, as old Homer expresses
it,</p>

<p class="tbp">And, truly, the army of Narcottus seemed wasted with a great
slaughter: yet on neither side, had the monarch been <i>checked</i>, so as
to be put in personal danger! "While there is life there is hope,"
said the surviving Bishop<a name="FNanchor_223_227" id="FNanchor_223_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_227" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> on the side of Narcottus: who now
taking upon him the command of the army, and perceiving Sir Launcelot
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span> be pretty nearly exhausted with fatigue, and wantonly exposing
his person, ordered the men at arms to charge him briskly on all
sides; while his own two castles kept a check upon the remaining
castle, knight, and bishop of the opposite army: also, he exhorted the
king to make a feint, as if about to march onwards. Sir Launcelot, on
perceiving the movement of the monarch, sprang forward to make him a
prisoner; but he was surprised by an elephant in ambuscade, from whose
castle-bearing back a well-shot arrow pierced his corslet, and
inflicted a mortal wound. He fell; but, in falling, he seemed to smile
even sweetly, as he thought upon the noble speech of Sir Bohort<a name="FNanchor_224_228" id="FNanchor_224_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_228" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
over the dead body of his illustrious ancestor, of the same name; and,
exhorting his gallant men to revenge his fall, he held the handle of
his sword firmly, till his whole frame was stiffened in death. And now
the battle was renewed with equal courage and equal hopes of victory
on both sides: but the loss of the flower of their armies, and
especially of their beloved spouses, had heavily oppressed the adverse
monarchs: who, retiring to a secured spot, bemoaned in secret the
hapless deaths of their queens, and bitterly bewailed that injudicious
law which, of necessity, so much exposed their fair persons, by giving
them such an unlimited power. The fortune of the day, therefore,
remained in the hands of the respective commanders; and if the knight
and bishop, on Philemon's side, had not contested about superiority of
rule, the victory had surely been with Philemon. But the strife of
these commanders threw every thing into confusion. The men, after
being trampled upon by the elephants of Narcottus, left their king
exposed, without the power of being aided by his castle. An error so
fatal was instantly perceived by the bishop of Narcottus's shattered
army; who, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span> another Ximenes,<a name="FNanchor_225_229" id="FNanchor_225_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_229" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> putting himself at the head of
his forces, and calling upon his men resolutely to march onwards, gave
orders for the elephants to be moved cautiously at a distance, and to
lose no opportunity of making the opposite monarch prisoner. Thus,
while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span> charged in front, and captured, with his own hands, the
remaining adverse knight, his men kept the adverse bishop from sending
reinforcements; and Philemon's elephant not having an opportunity of
sweeping across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span> the plain to come to the timely aid of the
king,<a name="FNanchor_226_230" id="FNanchor_226_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_230" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> the victory was speedily obtained, for the men upon the
backs of Narcottus's elephants kept up so tremendous a discharge of
arrows that the monarch was left without a single attendant: and, of
necessity, was obliged to submit to the generosity of his captors.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_225_229" id="Footnote_225_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_225_229">[225]</a> It is always pleasant to me to make
comparisons with eminent book-patrons, or, if the reader
pleases, bibliomaniacs. <span class="smcap">Cardinal Ximenes</span> was the promoter
and patron of the celebrated Complutensian Polyglott Bible;
concerning which I have already submitted some account to
the public in my <i>Introduction to the Classics</i>, vol. i.,
pp. 7, 8. His political abilities and personal courage have
been described by Dr. Robertson (in his history of Charles
V.), with his usual ability. We have here only to talk of
him as connected with books. Mallinkrot and Le Long have
both preserved the interesting anecdote which is related by
his first biographer, Alvaro Gomez, concerning the
completion of the forementioned Polyglott. "I have often
heard John Brocarius (says Gomez) son of Arnoldus Brocarius,
who printed the Polyglott, tell his friends that, when his
father had put the finishing stroke to the last volume, he
deputed <i>him</i> to carry it to the Cardinal. John Brocarius
was then a lad; and, having dressed himself in an elegant
suit of clothes, he gravely approached Ximenes, and
delivered the volume into his hands. 'I render thanks to
thee, oh God!' exclaimed the Cardinal, 'that thou hast
protracted my life to the completion of these biblical
labours.' Afterwards, when conversing with his friends,
Ximenes would often observe that the surmounting of the
various difficulties of his political situation did not
afford him half the satisfaction which he experienced from
the finishing of his Polyglott. He died in the year 1517,
not many weeks after the last volume was published." Gomez,
or Gomecius's work "<i>de rebus gestis, à Francisco Ximenio
Cisnerio Archiepiscopo Complut</i>," 1569, fol., is a book of
very uncommon occurrence. It is much to be wished that Lord
Holland, or Mr. Southey, would give us a life of this
celebrated political character: as the biographies of
Flechier and Marsolier seem miserably defective, and the
sources of Gomez to have been but partially consulted. But I
must not let slip this opportunity of commemorating the
book-reputation of <span class="smcap">Ximenes</span>, without making the reader
acquainted with two other singularly scarce and curious
productions of the press, which owe their birth to the
bibliomanical spirit of our Cardinal. I mean the "<i>Missale
mixtum</i> <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: secundum"><i>secundun</i></span> <i>regulum B.
Isidori, dictum Mozarabes, cum præfat.</i>" <i>A. Ortiz.</i> Toleti,
1500, fol. and the "<i>Breviarium, mixtum," &amp;c.</i> <i>Mozarabes.</i>
Toleti, 1502, fol.: of the former of which there was a copy
in the Harleian collection; as the ensuing interesting note,
in the catalogue of Lord Harley's books, specifies. I shall
give it without abridgment: "This is the scarcest book in
the whole Harleian collection. At the end of it are the
following words, which deserve to be inserted
here:&mdash;Adlaudem Omnipotentis Dei, nec non Virginis Mariæ
Matris ejus, omnium sanctorum sanctarumq; expletum est
Missale mixtum secundum regulam beati Isidori dictum
Mozarabes: maxima cum diligentia perlectum et emendatum, per

Melchioris Gorricii Novariensis, per Magistrum Petrum
Hagembach, Almanum, anno salutis nostræ 1500, Die 29<span class="super">o</span>
mensis Januarii." "This is supposed to be the ancient Missal
amended and purged by St. Isidore, archbishop of Sevil, and
ordered by the Council of Toledo to be used in all churches;
every one of which before that time had a missal peculiar to
itself. The Moors afterwards committing great ravages in
Spain, destroying the churches, and throwing every thing
there, both civil and sacred, into confusion, all St.
Isidore's missals, excepting those in the city of Toledo,
were lost. But those were preserved even after the Moors had
made themselves masters of that city; since they left six of
the churches there to the Christians, and granted them the
free exercise of their religion. Alphonsus the Sixth, many
ages afterwards, expelled the Moors from Toledo, and ordered
the Roman missal to be used in those churches where St.
Isidore's missal had been in vogue, ever since the council
above-mentioned. But the people of Toledo insisting that
their missal was drawn up by the most ancient bishops,
revised and corrected by St. Isidore, proved to be the best
by the great number of saints who had followed it, and been
preserved during the whole time of the Moorish government in
Spain, he could not bring his project to bear without great
difficulty. In short, the contest between the Roman and
Toletan missals came to that height that, according to the
genius of the age, it was decided by a single combat,
wherein the champion of the Toletan missal proved
victorious. But King Alphonsus, say some of the Spanish
writers, not being satisfied with this, which he considered
as the effect of chance only, ordered a fast to be
proclaimed, and a great fire to be then made; into which,
after the king and people had prayed fervently to God for
his assistance in this affair, both the missals were thrown;
but the Toletan only escaped the violence of the flames.
This, continue the same authors, made such an impression
upon the king that he permitted the citizens of Toledo to
use their own missal in those churches that had been granted
the Christians by the Moors. However, the copies of this
missal grew afterwards so scarce, that Cardinal Ximenes
found it extremely difficult to meet with one of them: which
induced him to order this impression, and to build a chapel,
in which this service was chanted every day, as it had at
first been by the ancient Christians. But, notwithstanding
this, the copies of the Toletan missal are become now so
exceeding rare that it is at present almost in as much
danger of being buried in oblivion as it was when committed
to the press by Cardinal Ximenes." <i>Bibl. Harl.</i>, vol. iii.,
p. 117. But let the reader consult the more extended details
of De Bure (<i>Bibl. Instruct.</i>, vol. i., n<span class="super">o</span>. 210, 211),
and De La Serna Santander (<i>Dict. Chois. Bibliogr. du</i> xv.
<i>Siecle</i>, part iii., p. 178); also the very valuable notice
of Vogt; <i>Cat. Libror. Rarior.</i>, p. 591; who mention a fine
copy of the missal and breviary, each struck off <span class="smcap">upon
vellum</span>, in the collegiate church of St. Ildefonso. If I
recollect rightly, Mr. Edwards informed me that an Italian
Cardinal was in possession of a similar copy of each. This
missal was republished at Rome, with a capital preface and
learned notes, by Lesleus, a Jesuit, in 1755, 4to.: and
Lorenzana, archbishop of Toledo, republished the breviary in
a most splendid manner at Madrid, in 1788. Both these
re-impressions are also scarce. I know not whether the late
king of Spain ever put his design into execution of giving a
new edition of these curious religious volumes; some ancient
MSS. of which had been carefully collated by Burriel.
Consult Osmont's <i>Dict. Typog.</i>, vol. i., p. 477; <i>Cat. de
Gaignat</i>, n<span class="super">os</span>. 179, 180; <i>Cat. de la Valliere</i>, n<span class="super">os</span>.

perhaps tediously, about these renowned volumes, let me
introduce to the notice of the heraldic reader the <i>Coat of
Arms</i> of the equally renowned Cardinal&mdash;of whose genuine
editions of the Mozarabic Missal and Breviary my eyes were
highly gratified with a sight, in the exquisite library of
Earl Spencer, at Althorp.</p>

<p class="tp">Thus ended one of the most memorable chess contests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span> upon record. Not
more stubbornly did the Grecians and Romans upon Troy's plain, or the
English and French upon Egypt's shores, contend for the palm of
victory, than did Philemon and Narcottus compel their respective
forces to signalize themselves in this hard-fought game. To change the
simile for a more homely one; no Northamptonshire hunt was ever more
vigorously kept up; and had it not been (at least so Philemon
thought!) for the inadvertent questions of Lysander, respecting the
antiquity of the amusement, an easy victory would have been obtained
by my guest over my neighbour. Lysander, with his usual politeness,
took all the blame upon himself. Philemon felt, as all
chess-combatants feel upon defeat, peevish and vexed. But the
admirably well adapted conversation of Lysander, and the natural
diffidence of Narcottus, served to smooth Philemon's ruffled plumage;
and at length diffused o'er his countenance his natural glow of good
humour.</p>

<p>It was now fast advancing towards midnight; when Narcottus withdrew to
his house, and my guests to their chambers.</p>

<p>To-morrow came; and with the morrow came composure and hilarity in the
countenances of my guests. The defeat of the preceding evening was no
longer thought of; except that Philemon betrayed some little marks of
irritability on Lysander's shewing him the fac-simile wood-cuts of the
pieces and men in Caxton's edition of the game of chess, which are
published in the recent edition of the Typographical Antiquities of
our country.</p>

<p>Lisardo visited us betimes. His countenance, on his entrance gave
indication of vexation and disappointment&mdash;as well it might; for, on
his return home the preceding evening, he found the following note
from Lorenzo:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"My dear Lisardo;</span></p>

</div>

<p>"Little," exclaimed Lisardo, "does he know of my conversion. I'll join
you uninvited; and abide by the consequences."</p>

<p>At four o'clock we set off, in company with Lisardo, for Lorenzo's
dinner. I need hardly add that the company of the latter was cordially
welcomed by our host; who, before the course of pastry was cleared
away, proposed a sparkling bumper of Malmsey madeira, to commemorate
his conversion to Bibliomaniacism. By half-past-five we were ushered
into <span class="smcap">the library</span>, to partake of a costly dessert of rock melons and
Hamburgh grapes, with all their appropriate embellishments of
nectarines and nuts. Massive and curiously cut decanters, filled with
the genuine juice of the grape, strayed backwards and forwards upon
the table: and well-furnished minds, which could not refuse the luxury
of such a feast, made every thing as pleasant as rational pleasure
could be.</p>

<p>I think we left off with an abuse of the anti-bibliomaniacal powers of
chivalry. Let us pursue a more systematic method; and begin, as
Lisardo says, "at the beginning."</p>

<p class="bp">In the plan which I may pursue, you must forgive me, my friends, if
you find it desultory and irregular: and, as a proof of the sincerity
of your criticism, I earnestly beg that, like the chivalrous judge, of
whom mention was made last night, you will cry out "<i>Ho!</i>" when you
wish me to cease. But where shall we begin? From what period shall we
take up the history of <span class="smcap">Bookism</span> (or, if you please, <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>) in
this country? Let us pass over those long-bearded gentlemen called the
Druids; for in the various hypotheses which sagacious antiquaries have
advanced upon their beloved <i>Stone-henge</i>, none, I believe, are to be
found wherein the traces of a <i>Library</i>, in that vast ruin, are
pretended to be discovered. As the Druids were sparing of their
writing,<a name="FNanchor_227_231" id="FNanchor_227_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_231" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> they probably read the more; but whether they carried
their books with them into trees, or made their pillows of them upon
Salisbury-plain, tradition is equally silent. Let us therefore
preserve the same prudent silence, and march on at once into the
seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries; in which the learning of Bede,
Alcuin, Erigena, and Alfred, strikes us with no small degree of
amazement. Yet we must not forget that their predecessor <span class="smcap">Theodore</span>,
archbishop of Canterbury, was among the earliest book-collectors in
this country; for he brought over from Rome, not only a number of able
professors, but a valuable collection of books.<a name="FNanchor_228_232" id="FNanchor_228_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_232" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Such, however,
was the scarcity of the book article, that Benedict Biscop (a founder
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span> monastery of Weremouth in Northumberland), a short time
after, made not fewer than five journeys to Rome to purchase books,
and other necessary things for his monastery&mdash;for one of which books
our immortal Alfred (a very <i>Helluo Librorum</i>! as you will presently
learn) gave afterwards as much land as eight ploughs could
labour.<a name="FNanchor_229_233" id="FNanchor_229_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_233" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> We now proceed to <span class="smcap">Bede</span>; whose library I conjecture to
have been both copious and curious. What matin and midnight vigils
must this literary phenomenon have patiently sustained! What a full
and variously furnished mind was his! Read the table of contents of
the eight folio volumes of the Cologne edition<a name="FNanchor_230_234" id="FNanchor_230_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_234" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> of his works, as
given by Dr. Henry in the appendix to the fourth volume of his history
of our own country; and judge, however you may wish that the author
had gone less into abstruse and ponderous subjects, whether it was
barely possible to avoid falling upon such themes, considering the
gross ignorance and strong bias of the age? Before this, perhaps, I
ought slightly to have noticed <span class="smcap">Ina</span>, king of the West Saxons, whose
ideas of the comforts of a monastery, and whose partiality to
<i>handsome book-binding</i>, we may gather from a curious passage in
Stow's Chronicle or Annals.<a name="FNanchor_231_235" id="FNanchor_231_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_235" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p class="tbp">Now, don't imagine, my dear Lisardo, that this anguish of heart

where it is thus told: "Johannes Erigena, surnamed Scotus, a
man renowned for learning, sitting at the table, in respect
of his learning, with Charles the Bauld, Emperor and King of
France, behaved himselfe as a slovenly scholler, nothing
courtly; whereupon the Emperor asked him merrily, <i>Quid
interest inter Scotum et Sotum</i>? (what is there between a
Scot and a Sot?) He merrily, but yet malapertly answered,
'<i>Mensa</i>'&mdash;(the table): as though the emperor were the Sot
and he the Scot." p. 236. <i>Roger Hoveden</i> is quoted as the
authority; but one would like to know where Hoveden got his
information, if Scotus has not mentioned the anecdote in his
own works? Since Camden's time, this facetious story has
been told by almost every historian and annalist.</p>

<p class="tbp">In his celebrated work upon predestination, he maintained that
"material fire is no part of the torments of the damned;"<a name="FNanchor_239_243" id="FNanchor_239_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_243" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> a very
singular notion in those times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span> frightful superstition, when the
minds of men were harrowed into despair by descriptions of hell's
torments&mdash;and I notice it here merely because I should like to be
informed in what curious book the said John Scotus Erigena acquired
the said notion? Let us now proceed to <span class="smcap">Alfred</span>; whose bust, I see,
adorns that department of Lorenzo's library which is devoted to
English History.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_239_243" id="Footnote_239_243"></a><a href="#FNanchor_239_243">[239]</a> "He endeavours to prove, in his logical way,
that the torments of the damned are mere privations of the
happiness, or the trouble of being deprived of it; so that,
according to him, material fire is no part of the torments
of the damned; that there is no other fire prepared for them
but the fourth element, through which the bodies of all men
must pass; but that the bodies of the elect are changed into
an ætherial nature, and are not subject to the power of
fire: whereas, on the contrary, the bodies of the wicked are
changed into air, and suffer torments by the fire, because
of their contrary qualities. And for this reason 'tis that
the demons, who had a body of an ætherial nature, were
massed with a body of air, that they might feel the fire."
<i>Mackenzie's Scottish Writers</i>: vol. i., 49. All this may be
ingenious enough; of its truth, a future state only will be
the evidence. Very different from that of Scotus is the
language of Gregory Narienzen: "Exit in inferno frigus
insuperabile: ignis inextinguibilis: vermis immortalis:
fetor intollerabilis: tenebræ palpabiles: flagella
cedencium: horrenda visio demonum: desperatio omnium
bonorum." This I gather from the <i>Speculum Christiani</i>, fol.
37, printed by Machlinia, in the fifteenth century. The idea
is enlarged, and the picture aggravated, in a great number
of nearly contemporaneous publications, which will be
noticed, in part, hereafter. It is reported that some
sermons are about to be published, in which the personality
of Satan is questioned and denied. Thus having, by the
ingenuity of Scotus, got rid of the fire "which is never
quenched"&mdash;and, by means of modern scepticism, of the devil,
who is constantly "seeking whom he may devour," we may go on
comfortably enough, without such awkward checks, in the
commission of every species of folly and crime!</p>

<p class="tbp">This great and good man, the boast and the bulwark of his country, was
instructed by his mother, from infancy, in such golden rules of virtue
and good sense that one feels a regret at not knowing more of the
family, early years, and character, of such a parent. As she told him
that "a wise and a good man suffered no part of his time, but what is
necessarily devoted to bodily exercise, to pass in unprofitable
inactivity"&mdash;you may be sure that, with such book-propensities as he
felt, Alfred did not fail to make the most of the fleeting hour.
Accordingly we find, from his ancient biographer, that he resolutely
set to work by the aid of his wax tapers,<a name="FNanchor_240_244" id="FNanchor_240_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_244" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> and produced some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
very respectable compositions; for which I refer you to Mr. Turner's
excellent account of their author:<a name="FNanchor_241_245" id="FNanchor_241_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_245" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> adding only that Alfred's
translation of Boethius is esteemed his most popular performance.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_240_244" id="Footnote_240_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_240_244">[240]</a> The story of the <i>wax tapers</i> is related both
by Asser and William of Malmesbury, differing a little in
the unessential parts of it. It is this: Alfred commanded
six wax tapers to be made, each 12 inches in length, and of
as many ounces in weight. On these tapers he caused the
inches to be regularly marked; and having found that one
taper burnt just four hours, he committed them to the care
of the keepers of his chapel; who, from time to time gave
him notice how the hours went. But as in windy weather the
tapers were more wasted&mdash;to remedy this inconvenience, he
placed them in a kind of lanthorn, there being no glass to
be met with in his dominions. This event is supposed to have
occurred after Alfred had ascended the throne. In his
younger days, Asser tells us that he used to carry about, in
his bosom, day and night, a curiously-written volume of
hours, and psalms, and prayers, which by some are supposed
to have been the composition of Aldhelm. That Alfred had the
highest opinion of Aldhelm, and of his predecessors and
contemporaries, is indisputable; for in his famous letter to
Wulfseg, Bishop of London, he takes a retrospective view of
the times in which they lived, as affording "churches and
monasteries filled with libraries of excellent books in
several languages." It is quite clear, therefore, that our
great Alfred was not a little infected with the
bibliomaniacal disease.</p>

most credulous of our early historians) to have founded the University
of Cambridge. The latter had probably greater abilities than his
predecessor; and a thousand pities it is that William of Malmesbury
should have been so stern and squeamish as not to give us the
substance of that old book, containing a life of Athelstan&mdash;which he
discovered, and supposed to be coeval with the monarch&mdash;because,
forsooth, the account was too uniformly flattering! Let me here,
however, refer you to that beautiful translation of a Saxon ode,

<p class="tbp">Let us pass by that extraordinary scholar, courtier, statesman, and
monk&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Dunstan</span>; by observing only that, as he was even more to
Edgar than Wolsey was to Henry VIII.&mdash;so, if there had then been the
same love of literature and progress in civilization which marked the
opening of the sixteenth century, Dunstan would have equalled, if not
eclipsed, Wolsey in the magnificence and utility of his institutions.
How many volumes of legends he gave to the library of Glastonbury, of
which he was once the abbot, or to Canterbury, of which he was
afterwards the Archbishop, I cannot take upon me to guess: as I have
neither of Hearne's three publications<a name="FNanchor_244_248" id="FNanchor_244_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_248" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> relating to Glastonbury in

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_244_248" id="Footnote_244_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_244_248">[244]</a> There is an ample Catalogue Raisonné of these
three scarce publications in the first volume of the
<i>British Bibliographer</i>. And to supply the deficiency of any
extract from them, in this place, take, kind-hearted reader,
the following&mdash;which I have gleaned from Eadmer's account of
St. Dunstan, as incorporated in Wharton's
<i>Anglia-Sacra</i>&mdash;and which would not have been inserted could
I have discovered any thing in the same relating to
book-presents to Canterbury cathedral.&mdash;"Once on a time, the
king went a hunting early on Sunday morning; and requested
the Archbishop to postpone the celebration of the mass till
he returned. About three hours afterwards, Dunstan went into
the cathedral, put on his robes, and waited at the altar in
expectation of the king&mdash;where, reclining with his arms in a
devotional posture, he was absorbed in tears and prayers. A
gentle sleep suddenly possessed him; he was snatched up into
heaven; and in a vision associated with a company of angels,
whose harmonious voices, chaunting <i>Kyrie eleyson, Kyrie
eleyson, Kyrie eleyson</i>, burst upon his ravished ears! He
afterwards came to himself, and demanded whether or not the
king had arrived? Upon being answered in the negative, he
betook himself again to his prayers, and, after a short
interval, was once more absorbed in celestial extasies, and
heard a loud voice from heaven saying&mdash;<i>Ite, missa est</i>. He
had no sooner returned thanks to God for the same, when the
king's clerical attendants cried out that his majesty had
arrived, and entreated Dunstan to dispatch the mass. But he,
turning from the altar, declared that the mass had been
already celebrated; and that no other mass should be
performed during that day. Having put off his robes, he
enquired of his attendants into the truth of the
transaction; who told him what had happened. Then, assuming
a magisterial power, he prohibited the king, in future, from
hunting on a Sunday; and taught his disciples the <i>Kyrie
eleyson</i>, which he had heard in heaven: hence this
ejaculation, in many places, now obtains as a part of the
mass service." Tom. ii., p. 217. What shall we say to "the
amiable and elegant Eadmer" for this valuable piece of
biographical information?&mdash;"The face of things was so
changed by the endeavours of Dunstan, and his master,

<p class="tbp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>We may open the eleventh century with <span class="smcap">Canute</span>; upon whose political
talents this is not the place to expatiate: but of whose
bibliomaniacal character the illuminated MS. of <i>The Four Gospels</i> in
the Danish tongue&mdash;now in the British Museum, and once this monarch's
own book&mdash;leaves not the shadow of a doubt! From Canute we may proceed
to notice that extraordinary literary triumvirate&mdash;Ingulph, Lanfranc,
and Anselm. No rational man can hesitate about numbering them among
the very first rate book-collectors of that age. As to <span class="smcap">Ingulph</span>, let us
only follow him, in his boyhood, in his removal from school to
college: let us fancy we see him, with his <i>Quatuor Sermones</i> on a
Sunday&mdash;and his <i>Cunabula Artis Grammaticæ</i><a name="FNanchor_245_249" id="FNanchor_245_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_249" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> on a week day&mdash;under
his arm: making his obeisance to Edgitha, the queen of Edward the
Confessor, and introduced by her to William Duke of Normandy! Again,
when he was placed, by this latter at the head of the rich abbey of
Croyland, let us fancy we see him both adding to, and arranging, its
curious library<a name="FNanchor_246_250" id="FNanchor_246_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_250" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>&mdash;before he ventured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span> upon writing the history of
the said abbey. From Ingulph we go to <span class="smcap">Lanfranc</span>; who, in his earlier
years, gratified his book appetites in the quiet and congenial
seclusion of his little favourite abbey in Normandy: where he
afterwards opened a school, the celebrity of which was acknowledged
throughout Europe. From being a pedagogue, let us trace him in his
virtuous career to the primacy of England; and when we read of his
studious and unimpeachable behaviour, as head of the see of
Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_247_251" id="FNanchor_247_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_251" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> let us acknowledge that a love of books and of mental
cultivation is among the few comforts in this world of which neither
craft nor misfortune can deprive us. To Lanfranc succeeded, in
book-fame and in professional elevation, his disciple <span class="smcap">Anselm</span>; who was
"lettered and chaste of his childhood," says Trevisa:<a name="FNanchor_248_252" id="FNanchor_248_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_252" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> but who was
better suited to the cloister than to the primacy. For, although, like
Wulston, Bishop of Worcester, he might have "sung a long mass, and
held him <i>apayred</i> with only the offering of Christian men, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
holden a clean <i>mayde</i>, and did no outrage in drink,"<a name="FNanchor_249_253" id="FNanchor_249_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_253" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> yet in his
intercourse with William II. and Henry I., he involved himself in
ceaseless quarrels; and quitted both his archiepiscopal chair and the
country. His memory, however, is consecrated among the fathers of
scholastic divinity.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_245_249" id="Footnote_245_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_245_249">[245]</a> These were the common school books of the

<p><a name="Footnote_246_250" id="Footnote_246_250"></a><a href="#FNanchor_246_250">[246]</a> Though the abbey of Croyland was burnt only
twenty-five years after the conquest, its library then
consisted of 900 volumes, of which 300 were very large. The
lovers of English history and antiquities are much indebted
to Ingulph for his excellent history of the abbey of
Croyland, from its foundation, A.D. 664, to A.D. 1091: into
which he hath introduced much of the general history of the
kingdom, with a variety of curious anecdotes that are no
where else to be found. <span class="smcap">Dr. Henry</span>: book iii., chap. iv., § 1
and 2. But Ingulph merits a more particular eulogium. The
editors of that stupendous, and in truth, matchless
collection of national history, entitled <i>Recueil des
Historiens des Gaules</i>, thus say of him: "Il avoit tout vu
en bon connoisseur, et ce qu'il rapporte, il l'écrit en
homme lettré, judicieux et vrai:" tom. xi., p. xlij. In case
any reader of this note and lover of romance literature
should happen to be unacquainted with the French language, I
will add, from the same respectable authority, that "The
readers of the <i>Round Table History</i> should be informed that
there are many minute and curious descriptions in <span class="smcap">Ingulph</span>
which throw considerable light upon the history of <i>Ancient
Chivalry</i>." Ibid. See too the animated eulogy upon him, at
p. 153, note <i>a</i>, of the same volume. These learned editors
have, however, forgotten to notice that the best, and only
perfect, edition of Ingulph's History of Croyland Abbey,
with the continuation of the same, by Peter de Blois and
Edward Abbas, is that which is inserted in the first volume
of Gale's <i>Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores Veteres</i>: Oxon, 1684.

flesh from his bones, as he hung on the rood, for
withholding the lands of certain bishoprics and abbies:
Polydorus not being ashamed to rehearse it. Somewhere they
call him a red dragon: somewhere a fiery serpent, and a
bloody tyrant; for occupying the fruits of their vacant
benefices about his princely buildings. Thus rail they of
their kings, without either reason or shame, in their
legends of abominable lies: Look Eadmerus, Helinandus,

curious account of</p>

<p class="center">"<i>The fresh and lusty beginnings of</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas Becket</span>."</p>

<p>As those authors report, which chiefly wrote Thomas Becket's
life&mdash;whose names are Herbert Boseham, John Salisbury,
William of Canterbury, Alen of Tewkesbury, Benet of
Peterborough, Stephen Langton, and Richard Croyland&mdash;he
bestoyed his youth in all kinds of lascivious lightness, and
lecherous wantonness. After certain robberies, rapes, and
murders, committed in the king's wars at the siege of
Toulouse in Languedoc, and in other places else, as he was
come home again into England, he gave himself to great
study, not of the holy scriptures, but of the bishop of
Rome's lousy laws, whereby he first of all obtained to be
archdeacon of Canterbury, under Theobald the archbishop;
then high chancellor of England; metropolitan, archbishop,
primate; pope of England, and great legate from antichrist's
own right side. In the time of his high-chancellorship,
being but an ale-brewer's son of London, John Capgrave saith
that he took upon him as he had been a prince. He played the
courtier altogether, and fashioned himself wholly to the
king's delights. He ruffled it out in the whole cloth with a
mighty rabble of disguised ruffians at his tail. He sought
the worldly honour with him that sought it most. He thought
it a pleasant thing to have the flattering praises of the
multitude. His bridle was of silver, his saddle of velvet,
his stirrups, spurs, and bosses double gilt; his expenses
far passing the expenses of an earl. That delight was not on
the earth that he had not plenty of. He fed with the
fattest, was clad with the softest, and kept company with
the plesantest. Was not this (think you) a good mean to live
chaste? I trow it was. <i>Englyshe Votaryes</i>, pt. ii., sign.
P. vi. rect. Printed by Tisdale, 8vo. The orthography is
modernized, but the words are faithfully <i>Balëan</i>! Thus
writes Tyndale: and the king made him (Becket) his
chancellor, in which office he passed the pomp and pride of
Thomas (Wolsey) cardinal, as far as the ones shrine passeth
the others tomb in glory and riches. And after that, he was
a man of war, and captain of five or six thousand men in
full harness, as bright as St. George, and his spear in his
hand; and encountered whatsoever came against him, and
overthrew the jollyest rutter that was in the host of
France. And out of the field, hot from bloodshedding, was he
made bishop of Canterbury; and did put off his helm, and put
on his mitre; put off his harness, and on with his robes;
and laid down his spear, and took his cross ere his hands
were cold; and so came, with a lusty courage of a man of
war, to fight an other while against his prince for the
pope; when his prince's cause were with the law of God, and
the pope's clean contrary. <i>Practise of Popish Prelates.</i>
<i>Tyndale's Works</i>, edit. 1572, p. 361. The curious
bibliographer, or collector of ancient books of biography,
will find a very different character of Becket in a scarce
Latin life of him, printed at Paris in the black letter, in
the fifteenth century. His archiepiscopal table is described
as being distinguished for great temperance and propriety:
"In ejus mensa non audiebantur tibicines non cornicines, non
lira, non fiala, non karola: nulla quidem præterquam mundam
splendidam et inundantem epularum opulentiam. Nulla gule,
nulla lascivie, nulla penitus luxurie, videbantur
incitamenta. Revera inter tot et tantas delicias quæ ei
apponebantur, in nullo penitus sardanapalum sed solum
episcopum sapiebat," &amp;c. <i>Vita et processus sancti Thome
Cantuariensis martyris super libertate ecclesiastica</i>;
Paris, 1495, sign. b. ij. rect. From a yet earlier, and
perhaps the first printed, mention of Becket&mdash;and from a
volume of which no perfect copy has yet been found&mdash;the
reader is presented with a very curious account of the
murder of the Archbishop, in its original dress. "Than were

the farther reputation of the nunns there, shall observe
that they spent a great part of their time in reading good
books. There was a common library for their use well
furnished with books, many of which were English, and divers
of them historical. The lives of the holy men and women,
especially of the latter, were curiously written <span class="smcap">on vellum</span>,
and many <span class="smcap">illuminations</span> appeared throughout, so as to draw
the nunns the more easily to follow their examples."
Hearne's edit. <i>Guil. Neubrig.</i>, vol. ii., p. 768. Again he
says, "It is probable they (certain sentences) were written
in large letters, equal to the writing that we have in the
finest books of offices, the best of which were for the use
of the nunns, and for persons of distinction, and such as
had weak eyes; and many of them were finely covered, not
unlike the Kiver for the Gospell book, given to the chapell
of Glastonbury by king Ina." p. 773. Can the enlightened
reader want further proof of the existence of the
<span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span> in the nunnery of Godstow? As to <i>Peterborough</i>
abbey, Gunston, in his history of the same place, has copied
the catalogue of the different libraries belonging to the
abbots. Benedict, who became abbot in 1177, had a collection
of no less than <i>fifty-seven</i> volumes. But alas! the book
reputation of this monastery soon fell away: for master
Robert, who died abbot in 1222, left but <i>seven</i> books
behind him; and Geoffrey de Croyland, who was abbot in 1290,
had only that dreary old gentleman, <i>Avicenna</i>, to keep him
company! At its dissolution, however, it contained 1700
volumes in MSS. <i>Gunton's Peterborough</i>, p. 173.
<i>Glastonbury</i> seems to have long maintained its reputation
for a fine library; and even as late as the year 1248 it
could boast of several classical authors, although the
English books were only four in number; the rest being
considered as "vetustas et inutilia." The classical authors
were Livy, Sallust, Tully, Seneca, Virgil, and Persius. See
<i>Joh. Confrat. Glaston.</i>, vol. ii., p. 423, 435: Hearne's
edit. "Leland," says Warton, "who visited all the
monasteries just before their dissolution, seems to have
been struck with the venerable air and amplitude of this
library." <i>Hist. Engl. Poetry</i>, Diss. ii.</p>

which consisted of three books, he published it at Oxford,
A.D. 1187, in the following manner, in three days. On the
first day he read the first book to a great concourse of
people, and afterwards entertained all the poor of the town.
On the second day he read the second book, and entertained
all the Doctors and chief scholars: and on the third day he
read the third book, and entertained the younger scholars,
soldiers, and burgesses."&mdash;"A most glorious spectacle (says
he), which revived the ancient times of the poets, and of
which no example had been seen in England." This is given by
Dr. Henry (b. iii., ch. 4, § 2), on the authority of
Giraldus's own book, <i>De rebus a se gestis</i>, lib. i. c. 16.
Twyne, in his arid little quarto Latin volume of the
<i>Antiquities of Oxford</i>, says not a word about it; and, what
is more extraordinary, it is barely alluded to by Antony
Wood! See Mr. Gutch's genuine edition of Wood's <i>Annals of
the University of Oxford</i>, vol. i., pp. 60, 166. Warton, in
his <i>History of English Poetry</i>, vol. i., Diss. ii., notices
Giraldus's work with his usual taste and interest.</p>

<p>which was the joint manufactory of the patron and his èleve.
As lately as the year 1666, Bacon's life formed the subject
of a "famous history," from which Walter Scott has given us
a facetious anecdote in the seventh volume (p. 10) of
<i>Dryden's Works</i>. But the curious investigator of ancient
times, and the genuine lover of British biography, will
seize upon the more prominent features in the life of this
renowned philosopher; will reckon up his great discoveries
in optics and physics; and will fancy, upon looking at the
above picture of his study, that an explosion from
gun-powder (of which our philosopher has been thought the
inventor) has protruded the palings which are leaning
against its sides. Bacon's "<i>Opus Majus</i>," which happened to
meet the eyes of Pope Clement IV., and which <i>now</i> would
have encircled the neck of its author with an hundred golden
chains, and procured for him a diploma from every learned
society in Europe&mdash;just served to liberate him from his
first long imprisonment. This was succeeded by a subsequent
confinement of twelve years; from which he was released only
time enough to breathe his last in the pure air of heaven.
Whether he expended 3000, or 30,000 pounds of our present
money, upon his experiments, can now be only matter of
conjecture. Those who are dissatisfied with the meagre
manner in which our early biographers have noticed the
labours of Roger Bacon, and with the <i>tetragonistical</i>
story, said by Twyne to be propagated by our philosopher, of
Julius Cæsar's seeing the whole of the British coast and
encampment upon the Gallic shore, "maximorum ope speculorum"
(<i>Antiquit. Acad. Oxon. Apolog.</i> 1608, 4to., p. 353), may be
pleased with the facetious story told of him by Wood
(<i>Annals of Oxford</i>, vol. i., 216, Gutch's edit.) and yet
more by the minute catalogue of his works noticed by Bishop
Tanner (<i>Bibl. Brit. Hibern.</i> p. 62): while the following
eulogy of old Tom Fuller cannot fail to find a passage to
every heart: "For mine own part (says this delightful and
original writer) I behold the name of Bacon in Oxford, not
as of an individual man, but corporation of men; no single
cord, but a twisted cable of many together. And as all the
acts of strong men of that nature are attributed to an
Hercules; all the predictions of prophecying women to a
Sibyll; so I conceive all the achievements of the Oxonian
Bacons, in their liberal studies, are ascribed to <span class="smcap">one</span>, as
chief of the name." <i>Church History</i>, book iii., p. 96.</p>

"great multitudes of their (the Jews) books fell into the

Antiquit. Univ. Oxon.</i>, vol. i., 77, 132&mdash;where I find
rather a slight notification of it&mdash;but, in the genuine
edition of this latter work, published by Mr. Gutch, vol.
i., p. 329, it is said: "At their (the Jews) expulsion,
divers of their tenements that were forfeited to the king,
came into the hands of William Burnell, Provost of Wells;
and <i>their books</i> (for many of them were learned) to divers
of our scholars; among whom, as is verily supposed, <span class="smcap">Roger

Hebrew rarities, that he could not elsewhere find. Also
that, when he died, he left them to the Franciscan library
at Oxon, which, being not well understood in after-times,
were condemned to moths and dust!" Weep, weep, kind-hearted

proud to celebrate his praises; nor would it be considered a disgrace
by the most eminent of modern experimental philosophers&mdash;of him, who

demonstration of his love of books; while his patronage of Chaucer
shews that he had accurate notions of intellectual excellence.

as being the property of an enemy to France!&mdash;Now, when we
read of this wonderfully chivalrous age, so glowingly
described by the great Gaston, Count de Foix, to Master
Froissart, upon their introduction to each other (vide St.
Palaye's memoir in the 10th vol. of <i>L'Acadamie des
Inscriptions</i>, &amp;c.), it does seem a gross violation (at
least on the part of the Monsieur of France!) of all
gentlemanly and knight-like feeling, to seize upon a volume
of this nature, as legitimate plunder! The robber should
have had his skin tanned, after death, for a case to keep

<p><a name="Footnote_265_269" id="Footnote_265_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265_269">[265]</a> <span class="smcap">Charles the Fifth</span>, of France, may be called
the founder of the Royal Library there. The history of his
first efforts to erect a national library is thus, in part,
related by the compilers of <i>Cat. de la Bibliothéque
Royale</i>, pt. i., p. ij.-iij.: "This wise king took advantage
of the peace which then obtained, in order to cultivate
letters more successfully than had hitherto been done. He
was learned for his age; and never did a prince love reading
and book-collecting better than did he! He was not only
constantly making transcripts himself, but the noblemen,
courtiers, and officers that surrounded him voluntarily
tendered their services in the like cause; while, on the
other hand, a number of learned men, seduced by his liberal
rewards, spared nothing to add to his literary treasures.
Charles now determined to give his subjects every possible
advantage from this accumulation of books; and, with this
view, he lodged them in one of the <i>Towers of the Louvre</i>;
which tower was hence called <i>La Tour de la Librarie</i>. The
books occupied three stories: in the first, were desposited
269 volumes; in the second 260; and in the third, 381
volumes. In order to preserve them with the utmost care (say
Sauval and Felibien), the king caused all the windows of the
library to be fortified with iron bars; between which was
painted glass, secured by brass-wires. And that the books
might be accessible at all hours, there were suspended, from
the ceiling, thirty chandeliers and a silver lamp, which
burnt all night long. The walls were wainscotted with Irish
wood; and the ceiling was covered with cypress wood: the
whole being curiously sculptured in bas-relief." Whoever has
not this catalogue at hand (vide <a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a>, ante) to make
himself master of still further curious particulars relating
to this library, may examine the first and second volume of
<i>L'Academie des Inscriptions</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;from which the preceding
account is taken. The reader may also look into Warton
(Diss. 11, vol. i., sign. f. 2); who adds, on the authority
of Boivin's <i>Mem. Lit.</i>, tom. ii., p. 747, that the Duke of
Bedford, regent of France, "in the year 1425 (when the
English became masters of Paris) sent his whole library,
then consisting of only 853 volumes, and valued at 2223
livres, into England," &amp;c. I have little doubt but that
Richard De Bury had a glimpse of this infantine royal
collection, from the following passage&mdash;which occurs
immediately after an account of his ambassadorial
excursion&mdash;"O beate Deus Deorum in Syon, quantus impetus
fluminis voluptatis lætificavit cor nostrum, quoties
Paradisum mundi <i>Parisios</i> visitare vacavimus ibi moraturi?
Ubi nobis semper dies pauci, præ amoris magnitudine,
videbantur. Ibi Bibliothecæ jucundæ super sellas aromatum

only room left to say of our <span class="smcap">De Bury</span>&mdash;that he was the friend
and correspondent of Petrarch&mdash;and that Mons. Sade, in his
<i>Memoirs of Petrarch</i>, tells us that "the former did in
England, what the latter all his life was doing in France,
Italy, and Germany, towards the discovery of the best
ancient writers, and making copies of them under his own
superintendence." De Bury bequeathed a valuable library of
MSS. to Durham, now Trinity College, Oxford. The books of
this library were first packed up in chests; but upon the
completion of the room to receive them, "they were put into
pews or studies, and chained to them." Wood's <i>History of
the University of Oxford</i>, vol. ii., p. 911. Gutch's edit.
De Bury's <i>Philobiblion</i>, from which so much has been
extracted, is said by Morhof to "savor somewhat of the
rudeness of the age, but is rather elegantly written; and
many things are well expressed in it relating to
bibliothecism." <i>Polyhist. Literar.</i>, vol. i., 187. The real
author is supposed to have been Robert Holcott, a Dominican
friar. I am, however, loth to suppress a part of what Warton
has so pleasantly written (as above alluded to by Lysander)
respecting such a favourite as <span class="smcap">De Bury</span>. "Richard de Bury,
otherwise called Richard Aungervylle, is said to have alone
possessed more books than all the bishops of England
together. Beside the fixed libraries which he had formed in
his several palaces, the floor of his common apartment was
so covered with books that those who entered could not with
due reverence approach his presence. He kept binders,
illuminators, and writers, in his palaces. Petrarch says
that he had once a conversation with him, concerning the
island called by the ancients Thule; calling him 'virum
ardentis ingenii.' While chancellor and treasurer, instead
of the usual presents and new-year's gifts appendant to his
office, he chose to receive those perquisites in books. By
the favour of Edward III. he gained access to the libraries
of most of the capital monasteries; where he shook off the
dust from volumes, preserved in chests and presses, which
had not been opened for many ages." <i>Philobiblion</i>, cap. 29,
30.&mdash;Warton also quotes, in English, a part of what had been
already presented to the reader in its original Latin form.

4. Prettily painted as is this picture, by Warton, the
colouring might have been somewhat heightened, and the
effect rendered still more striking, in consequence, if the
authority and the words of Godwyn had been a little attended
to. In this latter's <i>Catalogue of the Bishops of England</i>,
p. 524-5, edit. 1601, we find that De Bury was the son of
one <span class="smcap">Sir Richard Angaruill</span>, knight: "that he saith of
himselfe 'exstatico quodam librorum amore potenter se
abreptum'&mdash;that he was mightily carried away, and even
beside himself, with immoderate love of bookes and desire of
reading. He had alwaies in his house many chaplaines, all
great schollers. His manner was, at dinner and supper-time,
to haue some good booke read unto him, whereof he would
discourse with his chaplaines a great part of the day
following, if busines interrupted not his course. He was
very bountiful unto the poore. Weekely he bestowed for their
reliefe, 8 quarters of wheat made into bread, beside the
offall and fragments of his tables. Riding betweene
Newcastle and Durham he would give 8<i>l.</i> in almes; from
Durham to Stocton, 5<i>l.</i>: from Durham to Aukland, 5 marks;
from Durham to Middleham, 5<i>l.</i>" &amp;c. This latter is the
"pars melior" of every human being; and bibliomaniacs seem
to have possessed it as largely as any other tribe of
mortals. I have examined Richardson's magnificent reprint of
Godwyn's book, in the Latin tongue, London, 1743, folio; p.
747; and find nothing worth adding to the original text.</p>

Lorenzo meant only to guard Lysander against that minuteness of
narration which takes us into every library and every study of the

obliged to restrain himself in the same cause.<a name="FNanchor_267_271" id="FNanchor_267_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_271" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

checks himself by saying, that "in pursuit of these

</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> It belongs to me, Lysander, to solicit your forgiveness. If you
are not tired with the discussion of such a various and extensive
subject (and more particularly from the energetic manner in which it
is conducted on your part), rely upon it that your auditors cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>

glow; the flavour of the fruit is improved; and the scintillations of
your conversational eloquence are scattered amidst my books, my busts,
and my pictures. Proceed, I entreat you; but first, accept my libation
offered up at the shrine of an offended deity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You do me, and the <i>Bibliomania</i>, too much honour. If my

<p class="bp">If, among the numerous and gorgeous books which now surround us, it
should be my good fortune to put my hand upon one, however small or
imperfect, which could give us some account of the <i>History of British
Libraries</i>, it would save me a great deal of trouble, by causing me to
maintain at least a chronological consistency in my discourse. But,
since this cannot be&mdash;since, with all our love of books and of
learning, we have this pleasing desideratum yet to be supplied&mdash;I must
go on, in my usual desultory manner, in rambling among libraries, and
discoursing about books and book-collectors. As we enter upon the
reign of <span class="smcap">Henry IV.</span>, we cannot avoid the mention of that distinguished
library hunter, and book describer, <span class="smcap">John Boston</span> of Bury;<a name="FNanchor_268_272" id="FNanchor_268_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_272" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> who may
justly be considered the Leland of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span> his day. Gale, if I recollect
rightly, unaccountably describes his bibliomaniacal career as having
taken place in the reign of Henry VII.; but Bale and Pits, from whom
Tanner has borrowed his account, unequivocally affix the date of 1410
to Boston's death; which is three years before the death of Henry. It
is allowed, by the warmest partizans of the reformation, that the
dissolution of the monastic libraries has unfortunately rendered the
labours of Boston of scarcely any present utility.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_268_272" id="Footnote_268_272"></a><a href="#FNanchor_268_272">[268]</a> It is said of <span class="smcap">Boston</span> that he visited almost
every public library, and described the titles of every book
therein, with punctilious accuracy. Pits (593) calls him
"vir pius, litteratus, et bonarum litterarum fautor ac
promotor singularis." Bale (p. 549, edit. 1559) has even the
candour to say, "mirâ sedulitate et diligentia omnes omnium
regni monasteriorum bibliothecas invisit: librorum collegit
titulos, et authorum eorum nomina: quæ omnia alphabetico
disposuit ordine, et quasi unam omnium bibliothecam fecit."
What Lysander observes above is very true: "non enim
dissimulanda (says Gale) monasteriorum subversio, quæ brevi
spatio subsecuta est&mdash;libros omnes dispersit et <span class="smcap">Bostoni</span>
providam diligentiam, maxima ex parte, inutilem reddidit."
<i>Rer. Anglicar. Scrip. Vet.</i>, vol. iii., præf. p. 1. That
indefatigable antiquary, Thomas Hearne, acknowledges that,
in spite of all his researches in the Bodleian library, he
was scarcely able to discover any thing of Boston's which
related to Benedictus Abbas&mdash;and still less of his own
compositions. <i>Bened. Abbat.</i> vol. i., præf. p. xvii. It is
a little surprising that Leland should have omitted to
notice him. But the reader should consult Tanner's <i>Bibl.
Britan.</i>, p. xvii., 114.</p>

<p class="tbp">There is a curious anecdote of this period in Rymer's F&#339;dera,<a name="FNanchor_269_273" id="FNanchor_269_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_273" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
about taking off the duty upon <i>six barrels of books</i>, sent by a Roman
Cardinal to the prior of the Conventual church of St. Trinity,
Norwich. These barrels, which lay at the custom-house, were imported
duty free; and I suspect that Henry's third son, the celebrated John
Duke of Bedford, who was then a lad, and just beginning to feed his
bibliomaniacal appetite, had some hand in interceding with his father
for the redemption of the duty.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_269_273" id="Footnote_269_273"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269_273">[269]</a> Vol. viii., p. 501. It is a Clause Roll of
the 9th of Henry IV. A.D. 1407: "De certis Libris, absque
Custumenda solvenda, liberandis;" and affords too amusing a
specimen of custom-house latinity to be withheld from the
reader. "Mandamus vobis, quod certos libros <i>in sex Barellis

</div>

<p class="tbp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> This <span class="smcap">Duke of Bedford</span> was the most notorious bibliomaniac as well
as warrior of his age; and, when abroad, was indefatigable in stirring
up the emulation of Flemish and French artists, to execute for him the
most splendid books of devotion. I have heard great things of what
goes by the name of <i>The Bedford Missal</i>!<a name="FNanchor_270_274" id="FNanchor_270_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_274" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_270_274" id="Footnote_270_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270_274">[270]</a> This missal, executed under the eye and for
the immediate use of the famous John, Duke of Bedford
(regent of France), and Jane (the daughter of the Duke of
Burgundy) his wife, was, at the beginning of the 18th
century, in the magnificent library of Harley, Earl of
Oxford. It afterwards came into the collection of his
daughter, the well-known Duchess of Portland; at whose sale,
in 1786, it was purchased by Mr. Edwards for 215 guineas;
and 500 guineas have been, a few years ago, offered for this
identical volume. It is yet the property of this last
mentioned gentleman. Among the pictures in it, there is an
interesting one of the whole length portraits of the Duke
and Duchess;&mdash;the head of the former of which has been
enlarged and engraved by Vertue for his portraits to
illustrate the History of England. The missal frequently
displays the arms of these noble personages; and also
affords a pleasing testimony of the affectionate gallantry
of the pair; the motto of the former being "<span class="smcap">a vous entier</span>:"
that of the latter, "<span class="smcap">j'en suis contente</span>." There is a former
attestation in the volume, of its having been given by the
Duke to his nephew, Henry VI. as "a most suitable present."
But the reader shall consult (if he can procure it) Mr.
Gough's curious little octavo volume written expressly upon
the subject.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> And not greater than what merits to be said of it. I have seen
this splendid bijou in the charming collection of our friend &mdash;&mdash;. It
is a small thick folio, highly illuminated; and displaying, as well in
the paintings as in the calligraphy, the graphic powers of that age,
which had not yet witnessed even the dry pencil of Perugino. More
gorgeous, more beautifully elaborate, and more correctly graceful,
missals may be in existence; but a more curious, interesting, and
perfect specimen, of its kind, is no where to be seen: the portraits
of the Duke and of his royal brother Henry V. being the best paintings
known of the age. 'Tis, in truth, a lovely treasure in the book way;
and it should sleep every night upon an eider-down pillow encircled
with emeralds!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Hear him&mdash;hear him! Lysander must be a collateral descendant of
this noble bibliomaniac, whose blood, now circulating in his veins,
thus moves him to "discourse most eloquently."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Banter as you please; only "don't disturb the stream of my
eloquence."</p>

<p class="bp">The period of this distinguished nobleman was that in which
book-collecting began to assume a fixed and important character in
this country. Oxford saw a glimmering of civilization dawning in her
obscured atmosphere. A short but dark night had succeeded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
patriotic efforts of De Bury; whose curious volumes, bequeathed to
Trinity College, had laid in a melancholy and deserted condition 'till
they were kept company by those of <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>, Bishop of Worcester, <span class="smcap">Rede</span>,
Bishop of Chichester, and <span class="smcap">Humphrey</span> the good Duke of Gloucester.<a name="FNanchor_271_275" id="FNanchor_271_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_275" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
Now began the fashion (and may it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span> never fall to decay!) of making
presents to public libraries:&mdash;but, during the short and splendid
career of <span class="smcap">Henry V.</span>, learning yielded to arms: the reputation of a
scholar to that of a soldier. I am not aware of any thing at this
period, connected with the subject of our discourse, that deserves
particular mention; although we ought never to name this illustrious
monarch, or to think of his matchless prowess in arms, without
calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span> to mind how he adorned the rough character of a soldier by
the manners of a prince, the feelings of a Christian, and, I had
almost said, the devotion of a saint.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_271_275" id="Footnote_271_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_271_275">[271]</a> We will first notice <span class="smcap">Cobham</span>, Bishop of
Worcester: who "having had a great desire to show some love
to his mother the university of Oxford, began, about the
year 1320, to build, or at least to make some reparations
for <i>a Library</i>, over the old congregation house in the
north church-yard of St. Mary's; but he dying soon after,
before any considerable matter was done therein, left
certain moneys for the carrying on of the work, and all his
books, with others that had been lately procured, to be,
with those belonging to the university (as yet kept in
chests) reposed therein." Some controversy afterwards
arising between the University and Oriel College, to which
latter Cobham belonged, the books lay in dreary and
neglected state till 1367; when a room having been built for
their reception, it was settled that they "should be reposed
and chained in the said room or solar; that the scholars of
the University should have free ingress and regress, at
certain times, to make proficiency in them; that certain of
the said books, of greater price, should be sold, till the
sum of <i>l.</i> 40 was obtained for them (unless other remedy
could be found) with which should be bought an yearly rent
of <i>l.</i> 3, for the maintenance of a chaplain, that should
pray for the soul of the said bishop, and other benefactors
of the University both living and dead, and have the custody
or oversight of the said books, and of those in the ancient
chest of books, and chest of rolls." Wood's <i>Hist. of the
University of Oxford</i>, vol. ii., pt. ii., 911. Gutch's edit.
<span class="smcap">William Rede</span>, or <span class="smcap">Read</span>, bishop of Chichester, "sometimes
Fellow (of Merton College) gave a chest with <i>l.</i> 100 in
gold in it, to be borrowed by the Fellows for their relief;
bond being first given in by them to repay it at their
departure from the college; or, in case they should die, to
be paid by their executors: A.D. 1376. He also built, about
the same time, <i>a Library</i> in the college; being the first
that the society enjoyed, and gave books thereunto." Wood's
<i>History of the Colleges and Halls</i>, p. 15, Gutch's edit. In
Mr. Nicholl's <i>Appendix to the History of Leicester</i>, p.
105, note 20, I find some account of this distinguished
literary character, taken from Tanner's <i>Bibl. Britan.</i>, p.
618. He is described, in both authorities, as being a very
learned Fellow of Merton College, where he built and
furnished <i>a noble library</i>; on the wall of which was
painted his portrait, with this inscription: "<span class="smcap">Gulielmus
Redæus, episcopus Cicestrensis, Magister in theologia,
profundus astronomus, quondam socius istius collegii, qui
hanc librariam fieri fecit</span>." Many of Read's mathematical
instruments, as well as his portrait, were preserved in the
library when Harrison wrote his description of England,
prefix'd to Holinshed's Chronicles; some of the former of
which came into the possession of the historian. For thus
writes Harrison: "William Read, sometime fellow of Merteine
college in Oxford, doctor of divinitie, and the most
profound astronomer that liued in his time, as appeareth by
his collection, which some time I did possesse; his image is
yet in the librarie there; and manie instruments of
astronomie reserued in that house," &amp;c. <i>Chronicles</i> (1587),
edit. 1807, vol. i., p. 237. In the year 1808, when I
visited the ancient and interesting brick-floored library of
Merton College, for the purpose of examining early printed
books, I looked around in vain for the traces, however
faded, of Read's portrait: nor could I discover a single
vestige of the <span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Readiana</span>! The memory of this once
celebrated bishop lives therefore only in what books have
recorded of him; and this brief and <i>verbal picture</i> of Read
is here drawn&mdash;as was the more finished resemblance of
Chaucer by the pencil, which Occleve has left  behind&mdash;</p>

"As for the books which he gave (says Wood) they were very
many, more by far than authors report; for whereas 'tis said
he gave 129, you shall find anon that they were more than
treble the number." The Duke's first gift, in 1439, of one
hundred and twenty-nine treatises, was worth, according to
Wood, a thousand pounds. All his book presents, "amounting
to above 600 (mostly treating of divinity, physic, history,
and humanity) which were from several parts of the world
obtained, were transmitted to the university, and for the
present laid up in chests in Cobham's library. The catalogue

<p class="tbp">The reign of his successor, <span class="smcap">Henry VI.</span>, was the reign of trouble and
desolation. It is not to be wondered that learning drooped, and
religion "waxed faint," 'midst the din of arms and the effusion of
human blood. Yet towards the close of this reign some attempt was made
to befriend the book cause; for the provost and fellows of Eton and
Cambridge petitioned the king to assist them in increasing the number
of books in their libraries;<a name="FNanchor_272_276" id="FNanchor_272_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_276" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> but the result of this petition has

<p><a name="Footnote_272_276" id="Footnote_272_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_272_276">[272]</a> In the manuscript history of Eton College, in
the British Museum (<i>MSS. Donat.</i> 4840, p. 154.), the
Provost and Fellows of Eton and Cambridge are stated, in the
25th of Henry the Sixth, to have petitioned the king that,
as these new colleges were not sufficiently seised of books
for divine service, and for their libraries, he would be
pleased to order one of his chaplains, Richard Chestre, "to
take to him such men as shall be seen to him expedient in
order to get knowledge where such bookes may be found,
paying a reasonable price for the same, and that the sayd
men might have the first choice of such bookes, ornaments,
&amp;c., before any man, and in especiall of all manner of
bookes, ornaments, and other necessaries as now <i>late were
perteynyng to the Duke of Gloucester</i>, and that the king
would particular(ly) cause to be employed herein John Pye
his stacioner of London." For this anecdote I am indebted to
Sir H. Ellis. See also the interesting note in Warton's

<p class="tbp">I had nearly passed through the reign of Henry the Sixth without

conceived that no cathedral could be perfect without a library.
Accordingly, he not only brought together an extraordinary number of
curious books, but framed laws or regulations concerning the treatment
of the books, and the hours of perusing them; which, if I can trust to
my memory, are rather curious, and worth your examination. They are in

<p class="tbp">We now enter upon the reign of an active and enterprising monarch;
who, though he may be supposed to have cut his way to the throne by
his sword, does not appear to have persecuted the cause of learning;
but rather to have looked with a gracious eye upon its operations by
means of the press. In the reign of <span class="smcap">Edward IV.</span>, our venerable and
worthy Caxton fixed the first press that ever was set to work in this
country, in the abbey of Westminster. Yes, Lorenzo; now commenced more
decidedly, the æra of <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>! Now the rich, and comparatively
poor, began to build them small <i>Book Rooms</i> or <i>Libraries</i>. At first,
both the architecture and furniture were sufficiently rude, if I
remember well the generality of wood cuts of ancient book-boudoirs:&mdash;a
few simple implements only being deemed necessary; and a three-legged
stool, "in fashion square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span> or round," as Cowper<a name="FNanchor_274_278" id="FNanchor_274_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_278" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> says, was thought
luxury sufficient for the hard student to sit upon. Now commenced a
general love and patronage of books: now (to borrow John Fox's
language) "tongues became known, know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>ledge grew, judgment increased,
<span class="smcap">books were dispersed</span>, the scripture was read, stories were opened,
times compared, truth discerned, falsehood detected, and with finger
pointed (at)&mdash;and all, <span class="smcap">through the benefit of printing</span>."<a name="FNanchor_275_279" id="FNanchor_275_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_279" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Now you have arrived at this period, pray concentrate your
anecdotes into a reasonable compass. As you have inveigled us into the
printing-office of Caxton, I am fearful, from your strong attachment
to him, that we shall not get over the threshhold of it, into the open
air again, until midnight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Order, order, Lisardo! This is downright rudeness. I appeal to
the chair!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenz.</span> Lisardo is unquestionably reprehensible. His eagerness makes
him sometimes lose sight of good breeding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I was going to mention some <i>Vellum</i> and <i>Presentation</i>
copies&mdash;but I shall hurry forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Nay, if you love me, omit nothing about "vellum and presentation
copies." Speak at large upon these glorious subjects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Poor Lisardo!&mdash;we must build an iron cage to contain such a
book-madman as he promises to become!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Proceed, dear Lysander, and no longer heed these interruptions.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Nay, I was only about to observe that, as Caxton is known to
have printed <i>upon vellum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_276_280" id="FNanchor_276_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_280" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> it is most probable that one of his
presentation copies of the romances of <i>Jason and Godfrey of Boulogne</i>
(executed under the patronage of Edward IV.), might have been printed
in the same manner. Be this as it may, it seems reasonable to conclude
that Edward the Fourth was not only fond of books, as objects of
beauty or curiosity, but that he had some affection for literature and
literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span> characters; for how could the firm friend and generous
patron of <span class="smcap">Tiptoft, Earl</span> of <span class="smcap">Worcester</span>&mdash;with whom this monarch had spent
many a studious, as well as jovial, hour&mdash;be insensible to the charms
of intellectual refinement! Pause we here for one moment&mdash;and let us
pour the juice of the blackest grape upon the votive tablet,
consecrated to the memory of this illustrious nobleman! and, as Caxton
has become so fashionable<a name="FNanchor_277_281" id="FNanchor_277_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_281" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> among us, I will read to you, from
yonder beautiful copy of his English edition of "<i>Tully upon
Friendship</i>," a part of our printer's affecting eulogy upon the
translator:&mdash;"O good blessed Lord God, what great loss was it of that
noble, virtuous, and well-disposed lord! When I remember and advertise
his life, his science, and his virtue, me thinketh God not displeased
over a great loss of such a man, considering his estate and cunning,"
&amp;c. "At his death every man that was there, might learn to die and
take his (own) death patiently; wherein I hope and doubt not, but that
God received his soul into his everlasting bliss. For as I am informed
he right advisedly ordained all his things, as well for his last will
of worldly goods, as for his soul's health; and patiently, and holily,
without grudging, in charity, to fore that he departed out of this
world: which is gladsome and joyous to hear."&mdash;What say you to this
specimen of Caxtonian eloquence?</p>

excellent book-binder: who, in his mode of re-binding
ancient books is not only scrupulously particular in the
preservation of that important part of a volume, the margin;
but, in his ornaments of tooling, is at once tasteful and
exact. Notwithstanding these hard times, and rather a
slender bodily frame, and yet more slender purse&mdash;with five

Faulkener is in his three-pair-of-stairs confined workshop
by five in the morning winter and summer, and oftentimes
labours 'till twelve at night. Severer toil, with more
uniform good humour and civility in the midst of all his
embarrassments, were never perhaps witnessed in a brother of
the ancient and respectable craft of <i>Book-binding</i>!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I entreat you not to inflame my imagination by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span> such tantalizing
pictures! You know this must ever be a fiction: the most successful
bibliomaniac never attained to such human happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Leave Lisardo to his miseries, and proceed.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I have supposed Edward to have spent some jovial hours with
this unfortunate nobleman. It is thought that our monarch and he
partook of the superb feast which was given by the famous <span class="smcap">Nevell</span>,
archbishop of York, at the inthronization of the latter; and I am
curious to know of what the library of such a munificent
ecclesiastical character was composed! But perhaps this feast
itself<a name="FNanchor_282_286" id="FNanchor_282_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_286" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> is one of Lisardo's fictions.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_282_286" id="Footnote_282_286"></a><a href="#FNanchor_282_286">[282]</a> Lysander is perfectly correct about the feast
which was given at the archbishop's inthronization; as the
particulars of it&mdash;"out of an old paper roll in the archives
of the Bodleian library," are given by Hearne in the sixth
volume of <i>Leland's Collectanea</i>, p. 1-14: and a most
extraordinary and amusing bill of fare it is. The last
twenty dinners given by the Lord Mayors at Guildhall, upon
the first day of their mayoralties, were only
<i>sandwiches</i>&mdash;compared with such a repast! What does the
reader think of 2000 chickens, 4000 pigeons, 4000 coneys,
500 "and mo," stags, bucks, and roes, with 4000 "pasties of
venison colde?"&mdash;and these barely an 18th part of the kind
of meats served up! At the high table our amiable <span class="smcap">Earl</span> of
<span class="smcap">Worcester</span> was seated, with the Archbishop, three Bishops,
the Duke of Suffolk, and the Earl of Oxford. The fictitious
archiepiscopal feast was the one intended to be given by
<span class="smcap">Nevell</span> to Edward IV.; when the latter "appointed a day to
come to hunt in More in Hertfordshire, and make merry with
him." Nevell made magnificent preparations for the royal
visit; but instead of receiving the monarch as a guest, he
was saluted by some of his officers, who "arrested him for
treason," and imprisoned him at Calais and Guisnes. The
cause of this sudden, and apparently monstrous, conduct, on
the part of Edward, has not been told by Stow (<i>Chronicles</i>,
p. 426; edit. 1615), nor by Godwyn, (<i>Catalogue of the
Bishops of England</i>, p. 481, edit. 1601): both of whom
relate the fact with singular naiveté. I have a strong
suspicion that Nevell was so far a bibliomaniac as to have
had a curious collection of <i>astrological books</i>; for "there
was greate correspondency betweene this Archbishop and the
Hermetique philosophers of his time; and this is partly
confirmed to me from Ripley's dedication of his '<i>Medulla</i>'
to him, ann. 1746; as also the presentation of Norton's
'<i>Ordinall</i>,'" &amp;c. Thus writes Ashmole, in his <i>Theatrum
Chemicum</i>, p. 455.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">Enough has probably been said of Edward. We will stop, therefore, but
a minute, to notice the completion of the <span class="smcap">Humphrey Library</span>, and the

this period, Hearne tells us, from a letter sent by him to
Thomas Baker, that there was "a chaplein of the Universitie
chosen, after the maner of a Bedell, and to him was the
custodie of the librarye committed, his stipend&mdash;cvi<i>s</i>. and

not to deface theim, and everye one after at his proceedings

above, of the reign of Henry the Seventh being the "<span class="smcap">Augustan
age</span> for <span class="smcap">books</span>," he must be supposed to allude to the
facility and beauty of publishing them by means of <span class="smcap">the
press</span>: for at this period, abroad, the typographical
productions of Verard, Eustace, Vostre, Bonfons, Pigouchet,
Regnier, and many others ("quæ nunc perscribere longum est")
were imitated, and sometimes equalled by W. de Worde,
Pynson, and Notary, at home. In regard to <i>intellectual</i>
fame, if my authority be good, "in the reign of Henry VII.
Greek was a stranger in both universities; and so little
even of Latin had Cambridge, of its own growth, that it had
not types sufficient to furnish out the common letters and
epistles of the University. They usually employed an
Italian, one Caius Auberinus, to compose them, whose
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: ordinary">ordinarry</span> fee was twentypence
a letter." (MSS. in Benet College Library, lib. P. p. 194,)
<i>Ridley's Life of Ridley</i>, p. 22. "Greek began to be taught
in both universities: quietly at Cambridge, but ('Horresco
referens!') with some tumult at Oxford!" <i>ibid.</i></p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Before we proceed to discuss the bibliomaniacal ravages of this
age, we had better retire, with Lorenzo's leave, to the <span class="smcap">drawing-room</span>;
to partake of a beverage less potent than that which is now before us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenz.</span> Just as you please. But I should apprehend that Lysander could
hold out 'till he reached the Reformation;&mdash;and, besides, I am not
sure whether our retreat be quite ready for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Pray let us not take leave of all these beauteous books, and
busts, and pictures, just at present. If Lysander's lungs will bear

quite ready for our reception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Settle it between yourselves. But I think I could hold out for
another twenty minutes&mdash;since you will make me your only book-orator.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lorenz.</span> Let it be so, then. I will order the lamps to be lit; so that
Lisardo may see his favourite Wouvermans and Berghems, in company with
my romances, (which latter are confined in my satin-wood book-case) to
every possible degree of perfection!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Provided you indulge me also with a sight of these delightful
objects, you shall have what you desire:&mdash;and thus I proceed:</p>

<p class="bp">Of the great passion of <span class="smcap">Henry the VIIth</span> for fine books, even before he
ascended the throne of England,<a name="FNanchor_285_289" id="FNanchor_285_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_289" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> there is certainly no doubt. And
while he was king, we may judge, even from the splendid fragments of
his library, which are collected in the British Museum, of the nicety
of his taste, and of the soundness of his judgment. That he should
love extravagant books of devotion,<a name="FNanchor_286_290" id="FNanchor_286_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_290" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> as well as histories and
chronicles, must be considered the fault of the age, rather than of
the individual. I will not, however, take upon me to say that the
slumbers of this monarch were disturbed in consequence of the
extraordinary and frightful passages, which, accompanied with bizarre
cuts,<a name="FNanchor_287_291" id="FNanchor_287_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_291" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> were now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>troduced into almost every work, both of
ascetic divinity and also of plain practical morality. His
predecessor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> Richard, had in all probability been alarmed by the
images which the reading of these books had created; and I guess that
it was from such frightful objects, rather than from the ghosts of his
murdered brethren, that he was compelled to pass a sleepless night
before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span> the memorable battle of Bosworth Field. If one of those
artists who used to design the horrible pictures which are engraved in
many old didactic volumes of this period had ventured to take a peep
into Richard's tent, I question whether he would not have seen, lying
upon an oaken table, an early edition of some of those fearful works
of which he had himself aided in the embellishment, and of which
Heinecken has given us such curious fac-similes:<a name="FNanchor_288_292" id="FNanchor_288_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_292" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>&mdash;and this, in my
humble apprehension, is quite sufficient to account for all the
terrible workings in Richard, which Shakespeare has so vividly
described.</p>

<span class="smcap">Henry's</span> arms, with his name&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henricvs Dvx Richmvndiæ</span>. The
very view of such a book, while it gives comfort to a
low-spirited bibliomaniac, adds energy to the perseverance
of a young collector! the latter of whom fondly, but vainly,
thinks he may one day be blessed with a similar treasure!</p>

sufficient of Henry's attachment to extravagant books of
devotion.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_287_291" id="Footnote_287_291"></a><a href="#FNanchor_287_291">[287]</a> It is certainly one of the comforts of modern
education, that girls and boys have nothing to do, even in
the remotest villages, with the perusal of such books as
were put into the juvenile hands of those who lived towards
the conclusion of the 15th century. One is at a loss to
conceive how the youth of that period could have ventured at
night out of doors, or slept alone in a darkened room,
without being frightened out of their wits! Nor could
maturer life be uninfluenced by reading such volumes as are
alluded to in the text: and as to the bed of death&mdash;<i>that</i>
must have sometimes shaken the stoutest faith, and disturbed
the calmest piety. For what can be more terrible, and at the
same time more audacious, than human beings arrogating to
themselves the powers of the deity, and denouncing, in
equivocal cases, a certainty and severity of future
punishment, equally revolting to scripture and common sense?
To drive the timid into desperation, and to cut away the
anchor of hope from the rational believer, seem, among other
things, to have been the objects of these "ascetic" authors;
while the pictures, which were suffered to adorn their
printed works, confirmed the wish that, where the reader
might not comprehend the text, he could understand its
illustration by means of a print. I will give two extracts,
and one of these "bizarre cuts," in support of the preceding
remarks. At <a href="#Page_168">page 168</a>, ante, the reader will find a slight
mention of the subject: he is here presented with a more
copious illustration of it. "In likewise there is none that
may declare the piteous and horrible cries and howlings the
which that is made in hell, as well of devils as of other
damned. And if that a man demand what they say in crying;
the answer: All the damned curseth the Creator. Also they
curse together as their father and their mother, and the
hour that they were begotten, and that they were born, and
that they were put unto nourishing, and those that them
should correct and teach, and also those the which have been
the occasion of their sins, as the bawd, cursed be the bawd,
and also of other occasions in diverse sins. The second
cause of the cry of them damned is for the consideration
that they have of the time of mercy, the which is past, in
the which they may do penance and purchase paradise. The
third cause is of their cry for by cause of the horrible
pains of that they endure. As we may consider that if an
hundred persons had every of them one foot and one hand in
the fire, or in the water seething without power to die,
what <i>bruit</i> and what cry they should make; but that should
be less than nothing in comparison of devils and of other
damned, for they ben more than an hundred thousand
thousands, the which all together unto them doeth
<i>noysaunce</i>, and all in one thunder crying and braying
horribly."&mdash;<i>Thordynary of Crysten Men</i>, 1506, 4to., k k.
ii., rect. Again: from a French work written "for the
amusement of all worthy ladies and gentlemen:"</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> But to return to Henry. I should imagine that his mind was not
much affected by the perusal of this description of books: but rather
that he was constantly meditating upon some old arithmetical work&mdash;the
prototype of Cocker&mdash;which, in the desolation of the ensuing half
century, has unfortunately perished. Yet, if this monarch be accused
of avaricious propensities&mdash;if, in consequence of speculating deeply
in <i>large paper</i> and <i>vellum</i> copies, he made his coffers to run over
with gold&mdash;it must be remembered that he was, at the same time, a
patron as well as judge of architectural artists; and while the
completion of the structure of King's college Chapel, Cambridge, and
the building of his own magnificent chapel<a name="FNanchor_289_293" id="FNanchor_289_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_293" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> at Westminster (in

the preservation of choice copies from Caxton's neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>ing press),
afford decisive proofs of Henry's skill in matters of taste, the
rivalship of printers and of book-buyers shews that the example of the
monarch was greatly favourable to the propagation of the Bibliomania.
Indeed, such was the progress of the book-disease that, in the very
year of Henry's death, appeared, for the first time in this country,
an edition of <i>The Ship of Fools</i>&mdash;in which work, ostentatious and
ignorant book-collectors<a name="FNanchor_290_294" id="FNanchor_290_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_294" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> are, amongst other characters, severely

<p class="tp">We have now reached the threshhold of the reign of <span class="smcap">Henry VIII.</span>&mdash;and of
the era of <span class="smcap">the Reformation</span>. An era in every respect most important,
but, in proportion to its importance, equally difficult to
describe&mdash;as it operates upon the history of the Bibliomania. Now
blazed forth, but blazed for a short period, the exquisite talents of
Wyatt, Surrey, Vaux, Fischer, More, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span> when he made his abode with

as the reader may <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: conceive">comceive</span> the
character of Lisardo to be, there were traits in it of marked goodness
and merit. His enthusiasm so frequently made him violate the rules of
severe politeness; and the quickness with which he flew from one
subject to another, might have offended a narrator of the gravity,
without the urbanity, of Lysander; had not the frankness with which he
confessed his faults, and the warmth with which he always advocated
the cause of literature, rendered him amiable in the eyes of those who
thoroughly knew him. The friends, whose company he was now enjoying,
were fully competent to appreciate his worth. They perceived that
Lisardo's mind had been rather brilliantly cultivated; and that, as
his heart had always beaten at the call of virtue, so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span> in a due
course of years, his judgment would become matured, and his opinions
more decidedly fixed. He had been left, very early in life, without a
father, and bred up in the expectation of a large fortune; while the
excessive fondness of his mother had endeavoured to supply the want of
paternal direction, and had encouraged her child to sigh for every
thing short of impossibility for his gratification.</p>

<p>In consequence, Lisardo was placed at College upon the most
respectable footing. He wore the velvet cap, and enjoyed the rustling
of the tassels upon his silk gown, as he paraded the High street of
Oxford. But although he could translate Tacitus and Theocritus with
creditable facility, he thought it more advantageous to gratify the
cravings of his body than of his mind. He rode high-mettled horses; he
shot with a gun which would have delighted an Indian prince; he drank
freely out of cut-glasses, which were manufactured according to his
own particular taste; and wines of all colours and qualities sparkled
upon his table; he would occasionally stroll into the Bodleian Library
and Picture Gallery, in order to know whether any acquisitions had
been recently made to them; and attended the Concerts when any
performer came down from London. Yet, in the midst of all his gaiety,
Lisardo passed more sombrous than joyous hours: for when he looked
into a book, he would sometimes meet with an electrical sentence from
Cicero, Seneca, or Johnson, from which he properly inferred that life
was uncertain, and that time was given us to prepare for eternity.</p>

<p>He grew dissatisfied and melancholy. He scrambled through his terms;
took his degree; celebrated his anniversary of twenty-one, by
drenching his native village in ale which had been brewed at his
birth; added two wings to his father's house; launched out into coin
and picture collecting; bought fine books with fine bindings; then
sold all his coins and pictures; and, at the age of twenty-five, began
to read, and think, and act for himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>At this crisis, he became acquainted with the circle which has already
been introduced to the reader's attention; and to which circle the
same reader may think it high time now to return.</p>

<p>Upon breaking up for <span class="smcap">the drawing room</span>, it was amusing to behold the
vivacity of Lisardo; who, leaping about Lysander, and expressing his
high gratification at the discourse he had already heard, and his
pleasure at what he hoped yet to hear, reminded us of what Boswell has
said of Garrick, who used to flutter about Dr. Johnson, and try to
soften his severity by a thousand winning gestures.</p>

<p>The doors were opened; and we walked into Lorenzo's Drawing Room. The
reader is not to figure to himself a hundred fantastical and fugitive
pieces of furniture, purchased at Mr. Oakley's, and set off with
curtains, carpet, and looking-glasses&mdash;at a price which would have
maintained a country town of seven hundred poor with bread and soup
during the hardest winter&mdash;the reader will not suppose that a man of
Lorenzo's taste, who called books his best wealth, would devote two
thousand pounds to such idle trappings; which in the course of three
years, at farthest, would lose their comfort by losing their fashion.
But he will suppose that elegance and propriety were equally consulted
by our host.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a satin-wood book-case of 14 feet in width and 11 in
height, ornamented at the top with a few chaste Etruscan vases&mdash;a
light blue carpet, upon which were depicted bunches of grey roses,
shadowed in brown&mdash;fawn-coloured curtains, relieved with yellow silk
and black velvet borders&mdash;alabaster lamps shedding their soft light
upon small marble busts&mdash;and sofas and chairs corresponding with the
curtains&mdash;(and upon which a visitor might sit without torturing the
nerves of the owner of them) these, along with some genuine pictures
of Wouvermans, Berghem, and Rysdael, and a few other (subordinate)
ornaments, formed the furniture of Lorenzo's Drawing Room. As it was
<i>en suite</i> with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span> library, which was fitted up in a grave style or
character, the contrast was sufficiently pleasing.</p>

<p>Lisardo ran immediately to the book-case. He first eyed, with a greedy
velocity, the backs of the folios and quartos; then the octavos; and,
mounting an ingeniously-contrived mahogany rostrum, which moved with
the utmost facility, he did not fail to pay due attention to the
duodecimos; some of which were carefully preserved in Russia or
morocco backs, with water-tabby silk linings, and other appropriate
embellishments. In the midst of his book-reverie, he heard, on a
sudden, the thrilling notes of a harp&mdash;which proceeded from the
further end of the library!&mdash;it being Lorenzo's custom, upon these
occasions, to request an old Welch servant to bring his instrument
into the library, and renew, if he could, the strains of "other
times." Meanwhile the curtains were "let fall;" the sofa wheeled
round;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">

<p>with "the bubbling and loud hissing urn," "welcomed the evening in."
Lorenzo brought from his library a volume of Piranesi, and another of
engravings from the heads of Vandyke. Lisardo, in looking at them,
beat time with his head and foot; and Philemon and Lysander
acknowledged that Dr. Johnson himself could never have so much enjoyed
the beverage which was now before them.</p>

<p>If it should here be asked, by the critical reader, why our society is
not described as being more congenial, by the presence of those "whom
man was born to please," the answer is at once simple and
true&mdash;Lorenzo was a bachelor; and his sisters, knowing how long and
desperate would be our discussion upon the black letter and white
letter, had retreated, in the morning, to spend the day with Lisardo's
mother&mdash;whither &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; had been invited to join them.</p>

<p>The harper had now ceased. The tea-things were moved away; when we
narrowed our circle, and, two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span> us upon the sofa, and three upon
chairs, entreated Lysander to resume his narrative; who, after
"clearing his pipes (like Sir Roger de Coverley) with a loud hem or
two," thus proceeded.</p>

<p class="bp">"I think we left off," said Lysander, "with seating <span class="smcap">Henry the Eighth</span>
upon the throne of England. It will be as well, therefore, to say
something of this monarch's pretensions to scholarship and love of
books. Although I will not rake together every species of abuse which
has been vented against him by one Anthony Gilbie,<a name="FNanchor_291_295" id="FNanchor_291_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_295" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> yet Henry must
be severely censured, in the estimation of the most candid inquirer,
for that gross indifference which he evinced to the real interests of
literature, in calmly suffering the libraries of convents and
monasteries to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span> be pillaged by the crafty and rapacious. He was
bibliomaniac enough to have a few copies of his own work, in defence
of the Roman Catholic exposition of the Sacrament, struck off <span class="smcap">upon
vellum</span>:<a name="FNanchor_292_296" id="FNanchor_292_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_296" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> but when he quarrelled with the Roman pontiff about his
divorce from Queen Catharine, in order to marry Anne Boleyn,<a name="FNanchor_293_297" id="FNanchor_293_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_297" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
sounded the tocsin for the eventful destruction of all monastic
libraries: and although he had sent Leland, under an express
commission, to make a due examination of them, as well as a
statistical survey of the realm, yet, being frustrated in the
forementioned darling object, he cared for nothing about books,
whether <i>upon vellum</i> or <i>large paper</i>. But had we not better speak of
the book ravages, during the reformation, in their proper place?"</p>

<div class="footnotes">

Henry's Letters in answer to Luther's reply to the foregoing

pieces. I have seen some of Pynson's books printed upon
vellum; which are not remarkable for their beauty.</p>

When one thinks of the then imagined happiness of the fair
object of these epistles&mdash;and reads the splendid account of
her coronation dinner, by Stow&mdash;contrasting it with the
melancholy circumstances which attended her death&mdash;one is at
loss to think, or to speak, with sufficient force, of the
fickleness of all sublunary grandeur! The reader may,
perhaps, wish for this, "coronation dinner?" It is, in part,
strictly as follows: "While the queen was in her chamber,
every lord and other that ought to do service at the
coronation, did prepare them, according to their duty: as
the Duke of Suffolk, High-Steward of England, which was
richly apparelled&mdash;his doublet and jacket set with orient
pearl, his gown crimson velvet embroidered, his courser
trapped with a close trapper, head and all, to the ground,
of crimson velvet, set full of letters of gold, of
goldsmith's work; having a long white rod in his hand. On
his left-hand rode the Lord William, deputy for his brother,
as Earl Marshall, with ye marshal's rod, whose gown was
crimson velvet, and his horse's trapper purple velvet cut on
white satin, embroidered with white lions. The Earl of
Oxford was High Chamberlain; the Earl of Essex, carver; the
Earl of Sussex, sewer; the Earl of Arundel, chief butler; on
whom 12 citizens of London did give their attendance at the
cupboard; the Earl of Derby, cup-bearer; the Viscount Lisle,
panter; the Lord Burgeiny, chief larder; the Lord Broy,
almoner for him and his copartners; and the Mayor of Oxford
kept the buttery-bar: and Thomas Wyatt was chosen ewerer for
Sir Henry Wyatt, his father." "When all things were ready
and ordered, <span class="smcap">the queen</span>, under her canopy, came into the
hall, and washed; and sat down in the middest of the table,
under her cloth of estate. On the right side of her chair
stood the Countess of Oxford, widow: and on her left hand
stood the Countess of Worcester, all the dinner season;
which, divers times in the dinner time, did hold a fine
cloth before the Queen's face, when she list to spit, or do
otherwise at her pleasure. And at the table's end sate the
Archbishop of Canterbury, on the right hand of the Queen;
and in the midst, between the Archbishop and the Countess of
Oxford, stood the Earl of Oxford, with a white staff, all
dinner time; and at the Queen's feet, under the table, sate
two gentlewomen all dinner time. When all these things were
thus ordered, came in the Duke of Suffolk and the Lord
William Howard on horseback, and the Serjeants of arms
before them, and after them the sewer; and then the knights
of the Bath, bringing in the <i>first course</i>, which was eight
and twenty dishes, besides subtleties, and ships made of
wax, marvellous gorgeous to behold: all which time of
service, the trumpets standing in the window, at the nether
end of the hall, played," &amp;c. <i>Chronicles</i>; p. 566: edit.

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lorenz.</span> As you please. Perhaps you will go on with the mention of some
distinguished patrons 'till you arrive at that period?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Yes; we may now as well notice the efforts of that
extraordinary <i>bibliomaniacal triumvirate</i>, Colet, More, and Erasmus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Pray treat copiously of them. They are my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span> great favourites. But
can you properly place Erasmus in the list?</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You forget that he made a long abode here, and was Greek
professor at Cambridge. To begin, then, with the former. <span class="smcap">Colet</span>, as you
well know, was Dean of St. Paul's; and founder of the public school
which goes by the latter name. He had an ardent and general love of
literature;<a name="FNanchor_294_298" id="FNanchor_294_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_298" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> but his attention to the improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>ment of youth, in
superintending appropriate publications, for their use, was
unremitting. Few men did so much and so well, at this period: for
while he was framing the statutes by which his little community was to
be governed, he did not fail to keep the presses of Wynkyn De Worde
and Pynson pretty constantly at work, by publishing the grammatical
treatises of Grocyn, Linacre, Stanbridge, Lilye, Holte, Whittington,
and others&mdash;for the benefit, as well of the public, as of his own
particular circle. I take it, his library must have been both choice
and copious; for books now began to be multiplied in an immense ratio,
and scholars and men of rank thought <i>a Study</i>, or <i>Library</i>, of some
importance to their mansions. What would we not give for an
authenticated representation of Dean Colet in his library,<a name="FNanchor_295_299" id="FNanchor_295_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_299" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
surrounded with books? You, Lisardo, would be in ecstacies with such a
thing!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_294_298" id="Footnote_294_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_294_298">[294]</a> How anxiously does <span class="smcap">Colet</span> seem to have watched
the progress, and pushed the sale, of his friend Erasmus's
first edition of the Greek Testament! "Quod scribis de Novo
Testamento intelligo. Et libri novæ editionis tuæ <i>hic avide
emuntur et passim leguntur</i>!" The entire epistle (which may
be seen in Dr. Knight's dry Life of Colet, p. 315) is
devoted to an account of Erasmus's publications. "I am
really astonished, my dear Erasmus (does he exclaim), at the
fruitfulness of your talents; that, without any fixed
residence, and with a precarious and limited income, you
contrive to publish so many and such excellent works."
Adverting to the distracted state of Germany at this period,
and to the wish of his friend to live secluded and
unmolested, he observes&mdash;"As to the tranquil retirement
which you sigh for, be assured that you have my sincere
wishes for its rendering you as happy and composed as you
can wish it. Your age and erudition entitle you to such a
retreat. I fondly hope, indeed, that you will choose this
country for it, and come and live amongst us, whose
disposition you know, and whose friendship you have proved."
There is hardly a more curious picture of the custom of the
times relating to the education of boys, than the Dean's own
Statutes for the regulation of St. Paul's School, which he
had founded. These shew, too, the <i>popular books</i> then read
by the learned. "The children shall come unto the school in
the morning at seven of the clock, both winter and summer,
and tarry there until eleven; and return again at one of the
clock, and depart at five, &amp;c. In the school, no time in the
year, they shall use tallow candle, in no wise, but <i>only
wax candle</i>, at the costs of their friends. Also I will they
bring no meat nor drink, nor bottle, nor use in the school
no breakfasts, nor drinkings, in the time of learning, in no
wise, &amp;c. I will they use no cockfighting, nor riding about
of victory, nor disputing at Saint Bartholomew, which is but
foolish babbling and loss of time." The master is then
restricted, under the penalty of 40 shillings, from granting
the boys a holiday, or "remedy" (play-day), as it is here
called, "except the king, an archbishop, or a bishop,
present in his own person in the school, desire it." The
studies for the lads were "Erasmus's <i>Copia</i> et <i>Institutum
Christiani Hominii</i> (composed at the Dean's request),
<i>Lactantius</i>, <i>Prudentius</i>, <i>Juvencus</i>, <i>Proba</i> and
<i>Sedulius</i>, and <i>Baptista Mantuanus</i>, and such other as
shall be thought convenient and most to purpose unto the
true Latin speech; all barbary, all corruption, all Latin
adulterate, which ignorant blind fools brought into this
world, and with the same hath distained and poisoned the old
Latin speech, and the <i>veray</i> Roman tongue, which in the
time of Tully, and Sallust, and Virgil, and Terence, was
used&mdash;I say, that filthiness, and all such abusion, which
the later blind world brought in, which more rather may be
called <span class="smcap">Bloterature</span> than <span class="smcap">Literature</span>, I utterly banish and
exclude out of <span class="smcap">this school</span>." Knight's <i>Life of Colet</i>, 362,
4. The sagacious reader will naturally enough conclude that
boys, thus educated, would, afterwards, of necessity, fall
victims to the ravages of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>!</p>

with any stronger degree of probability than the exhibition
of the subjoined cut, of what might have been the interior
of <i>Dean Colet's Study</i>. This print is taken from an old
work, printed in the early part of the sixteenth century,
and republished in a book of Alciatus's emblems, translated
from the Latin into Italian, A.D. 1549, 8vo. There is an air
of truth about it; but the frame work is entirely modern,
and perhaps not in the purest taste. It may turn out that
this interior view of a private library is somewhat too
perfect and finished for the times of Colet, in this
country; especially if we may judge from the rules to be
observed in completing a public one, just about the period
of Colet's death: "Md. couenawntyd and agreid wyth Comell

was unquestionably, next to Erasmus, the most brilliant scholar of his
age: while the precious biographical memoirs of him, which have
luckily descended to us, place his character, in a domestic point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
view, beyond that of all his contemporaries. Dr. Wordsworth<a name="FNanchor_297_301" id="FNanchor_297_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_301" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> has
well spoken of "the heavenly mindedness" of More: but how are
bibliomaniacs justly to appreciate the classical lore, and
incessantly-active book-pursuits,<a name="FNanchor_298_302" id="FNanchor_298_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_302" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> of this scholar and martyr! How
he soared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span> "above his compeers!" How richly, singularly, and
curiously, was his mind furnished! Wit, playfulness, elevation, and
force&mdash;all these are distinguishable in his writings, if we except his
polemical compositions; which latter, to speak in the gentlest terms,
are wholly unworthy of his name. When More's head was severed from his
body, virtue and piety exclaimed, in the language of Erasmus,&mdash;"He is
dead: More, whose breast was purer than snow, whose genius was
excellent above all his nation."<a name="FNanchor_299_303" id="FNanchor_299_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_303" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

him, and an analysis of his English works. It would be
tedious to both the reader and author, here to repeat what
has been before written of Sir Thomas More&mdash;whose memory
lives in every cultivated bosom. Of this edition of the
Utopia there appeared a flimsy and tart censure in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, by a critic, who, it was manifest, had
never examined the volumes, and who, when he observes upon
the fidelity of Bishop Burnet's translation of the original

productions.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_300_304" id="Footnote_300_304"></a><a href="#FNanchor_300_304">[300]</a> It were much to be wished that Mr. Roscoe,
who has so successfully turned his attention to the history
of <i>Italian Literature</i>, of the period of Erasmus, would
devote himself to the investigation of the philological
history of the German schools, and more especially to the
literary life of the great man of whom Lysander is above
speaking. The biographical memoirs of Erasmus by Le Clerc,
anglicised and enlarged by the learned Jortin, and Dr.
Knight's life of the same, can never become popular. They
want method, style and interest. Le Clerc, however, has made
ample amends for the defectiveness of his biographical
composition, by the noble edition of Erasmus's works which
he put forth at Leyden, in the year 1703-6, in eleven
volumes folio: of which volumes the reader will find an
excellent analysis or review in the <i>Act. Erudit.</i>, A.D.
1704, &amp;c. Le Clerc, <i>Bibl. Choisie</i>, vol. i., 380; Du Pin's
<i>Bibl. Eccles.</i>, vol. xiv., and <i>Biblioth. Fabric</i>, pt. i.,
359; from which latter we learn that, in the public library,
at Deventer, there is a copy of Erasmus's works, in which
those passages, where the author speaks freely of the laxity
of the monkish character, have been defaced, "chartâ
fenestrata." A somewhat more compressed analysis of the
contents of these volumes appeared in the <i>Sylloge
Opusculorum Hist.-Crit., Literariorum, J.A. Fabricii, Hamb.</i>
1738, 4to., p. 363, 378&mdash;preceded, however, by a pleasing,
yet brief account of the leading features of Erasmus's
literary life. Tn one of his letters to Colet, Erasmus
describes himself as "a very poor fellow in point of
fortune, and wholly exempt from ambition." A little before
his death he sold his library to one John a Lasco, a
Polonese, for only 200 florins. (Of this amiable foreigner,
see <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Strype's">Stypye's</span> <i>Life of</i>
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Cranmer"><i>Crammer</i></span>; b. ii., ch. xxii.)
Nor did he&mdash;notwithstanding his services to booksellers&mdash;and
although every press was teeming with his lucubrations&mdash;and
especially that of Colinæeus&mdash;(which alone put forth 24,000
copies of his <i>Colloquies</i>) ever become much the wealthier
for his talents as an author. His bibliomaniacal spirit was
such, that he paid most liberally those who collated or
described works of which he was in want. In another of his
letters, he declares that "he shall not
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: receive">recieve</span> an <i>obolus</i> that year; as he
had spent more than what he had gained in rewarding those
who had made book-researches for him;" and he complains,
after being five months at Cambridge, that he had,
fruitlessly, spent upwards of fifty crowns. "Noblemen," says
he, "love and praise literature, and my lucubrations; but
they praise and do not reward." To his friend Eobanus Hessus
(vol. vi., 25), he makes a bitter complaint "de Comite
quodam." For the particulars, see the last mentioned
authority, p. 363, 4. In the year 1519, Godenus, to whom
Erasmus had bequeathed a silver bowl, put forth a facetious
catalogue of his works, in hexameter and pentameter verses;
which was printed at Louvain by Martin, without date, in
4to.; and was soon succeeded by two more ample and
methodical ones by the same person in 1537, 4to.; printed by
Froben and Episcopius. See Marchand's <i>Dict. Bibliogr. et
Histor.</i>, vol. i., p. 98, 99. The bibliomaniac may not
object to be informed that Froben, shortly after the death
of his revered Erasmus, put forth this first edition of the
entire works of the latter, in nine folio volumes; and that
accurate and magnificent as is Le Clerc's edition of the
same (may I venture to hint at the rarity of <span class="smcap">large paper</span>
copies of it?), "it takes no notice of the <i>Index
Expurgatorius</i> of the early edition of Froben, which has
shown a noble art of curtailing this, as well as other
authors." See <i>Knight's Life of Erasmus</i>, p. 353. The
mention of Froben and Erasmus, thus going down to
immortality together, induces me to inform the curious
reader that my friend Mr. Edwards is possessed of a chaste
and elegant painting, by Fuseli, of this distinguished
author and printer&mdash;the portraits being executed after the
most authentic representations. Erasmus is in the act of
calmly correcting the press, while Froben is urging with
vehemence some emendations which he conceives to be of
consequence, but to which his master seems to pay no
attention! And now having presented the reader (<a href="#Page_221">p. 221</a>,
ante) with the <i>supposed</i> study of Colet, nothing remains
but to urge him to enter in imagination, with myself, into
the <i>real</i> study of Erasmus; of which we are presented with
the exterior in the following view&mdash;taken from Dr. Knight's
<i>Life of Erasmus</i>; p. 124.

<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: permit">premit</span> me so to entitle it) with a
wood-cut exhibition of a different kind: it being perhaps
the earliest portrait of Erasmus published in this country.
It is taken from a work entitled, "<i>The Maner and Forme of
Confesion</i>," printed by <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Byddel">Byddell</span>, in 8vo., without date; and is placed immediately
under an address from Erasmus, to Moline, Bishop of Condome;
dated 1524; in which the former complains bitterly of "the
pain and grief of the reins of his back." The print is taken
from a tracing of the original, made by me, from a neat copy
of Byddel's edition, in the collection of Roger Wilbraham,
Esq. I am free to confess that it falls a hundred degrees
short of Albert Durer's fine print of him, executed A.D.
1526.

contained more beautiful or more numerous copies of precious volumes
than his own. For, when in favour with his royal master, Henry VIII.,
Wolsey had, in all probability, such an ascendency over him as to coax
from him almost every choice book which he had inherited from his
father, Henry VII.; and thus I should apprehend, although no

such a character as that of Wolsey having numerous copies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span> the
choicest books, bound in velvet of all colours, embossed with gold or
silver, and studded even with pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>cious stones! I conceive that his
own <i>Prayer Book</i> must have been gorgeous in the extreme! Unhappy
man&mdash;a pregnant and ever-striking example of the fickleness of human
affairs, and of the instability of human grandeur! When we think of
thy baubles and trappings&mdash;of thy goblets of gold, and companies of
retainers&mdash;and turn our thoughts to Shakspeare's shepherd, as
described in the soliloquy of one of our monarchs, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span> fully
disposed to admit the force of such truths as have been familiar to us
from boyhood, and which tell us that those shoulders feel the most
burdened upon which the greatest load of responsibility rests. Peace
to the once proud, and latterly repentant, spirit of Wolsey!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_302_306" id="Footnote_302_306"></a><a href="#FNanchor_302_306">[302]</a> In the last <i>Variorum edition of Shakspeare</i>,
1803, vol. xv., p. 144, we are referred by Mr. Douce to "the
particulars of this inventory at large, in Stowe's
<i>Chronicle</i>, p. 546, edit. 1631:" my copy of Stowe is of the
date of 1615; but, not a syllable is said of it in the place
here referred to, or at any other page; although the account
of Wolsey is ample and interesting. Mr. Douce (<i>ibid.</i>) says
that, among the <i>Harl. MSS.</i> (n<span class="super">o</span>. 599) there is one
entitled "An Inventorie of Cardinal Wolsey's rich householde
stuffe; temp. Hen. VIII.; the original book, as it seems,
kept by his own officers." In Mr. Gutch's <i>Collectanea
Curiosa</i>, vol. ii., 283-349, will be found a copious account
of Wolsey's plate:&mdash;too splendid, almost, for belief. To a
life and character so well known as are those of Wolsey, and
upon which Dr. Fiddes has published a huge folio of many
hundred pages, the reader will not here expect any
additional matter which may convey much novelty or interest.
The following, however, may be worth submitting to his
consideration. The Cardinal had poetical, as well as
political, enemies. Skelton and Roy, who did not fail to
gall him with their sharp lampoons, have shewn us, by their
compositions which have survived, that they were no
despicable assailants. In the former's "<i>Why come ye not to
Court?</i>" we have this caustic passage:</p>

<p>Steevens has also quoted freely from this poem of Skelton;
see the editions of <i>Shakspeare</i>, 1793, and 1803, in the
play of "King Henry VIII." Skelton's satire against Wolsey
is noticed by our chronicler Hall: "In this season, the
cardinal, by his power legantine, dissolved the convocation
at Paul's, called by the Archbishop of Canterbury; and
called him and all the clergy to his convocation to
Westminster, which was never seen before in England; whereof
Master Skelton, a merry poet, wrote:</p>

<p>In Mr. G. Ellis's <i>Specimens of the Early English Poets</i>,
vol. ii., pp. 7, 8, there is a curious extract from the same
poet's "<i>Image of Ypocrycye</i>"&mdash;relating to Sir Thomas
More&mdash;which is printed for the first time from "an
apparently accurate transcript" of the original, in the
possession of Mr. Heber. From the last mentioned work (vol.
ii., p. 11, &amp;c.), there is rather a copious account of a yet
more formidable poetical attack against Wolsey, in the
"<i>Rede me and be not wroth</i>," of William Roy: a very rare
and precious little black-letter volume, which, although it
has been twice printed, is scarcely ever to be met with, and
was unknown to Warton. It will, however, make its appearance
in one of the supplemental volumes of Mr. Park's valuable
reprint of the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>. While the cardinal was
thus attacked, in the biting strains of poetry, he was
doomed to experience a full share of reprobation in the
writings of the most popular theologians. William Tyndale
stepped forth to shew his zeal against papacy in his
"<i>Practise of Popishe Prelates</i>," and from this work, as it
is incorporated in those of Tyndale, Barnes, and Frith,
printed by Day in 1572, fol., the reader is presented with
the following amusing specimen of the author's vein of
humour and indignation: "And as I heard it spoken of divers,
he made, by craft of necromancy, graven imagery to bear upon
him; wherewith he bewitched the king's mind&mdash;and made the
king to doat upon him, more than he ever did on any lady or
gentlewoman: so that now the king's grace followed him, as
he before followed the king. And then what he said, that was
wisdom; what he praised, that was honourable only." Practise
of Popishe Prelates, p. 368. At p. 369, he calls him "Porter
of Heaven." "There he made a journey of gentlemen, arrayed
altogether in silks, so much as their very shoes and lining
of their boots; more like their mothers than men of war:
yea, I am sure that many of their mothers would have been
ashamed of so nice and wanton array. Howbeit, they went not
to make war, but peace, for ever and a day longer. But to
speak of the pompous apparel of my lord himself, and of his
chaplains, it passeth the xij Apostles. I dare swear that if
Peter and Paul had seen them suddenly, and at a blush, they
would have been harder in belief that they, or any such,
should be their successors than Thomas Didimus was to
believe that Christ was risen again from death." <i>Idem</i>, p.
370,&mdash;"for the worship of his hat and glory of his precious
shoes&mdash;when he was pained with the cholic of an evil
conscience, having no other shift, because his soul could
find no other issue,&mdash;he took himself a medicine, <i>ut
emitteret spiritum per posteriora</i>." Exposition upon the
first Ep. of St. John, p. 404. Thomas Lupset, who was a
scholar of Dean Colet, and a sort of <i>elève</i> of the
cardinal, (being appointed tutor to a bastard son of the
latter) could not suppress his sarcastical feelings in
respect of Wolsey's pomp and severity of discipline. From
Lupset's works, printed by Berthelet in 1546, 12mo., I
gather, in his address to his "hearty beloved Edmond"&mdash;that
"though he had there with him plenty of books, yet the place
suffered him not to spend in them any study: for you shall
understand (says he) that I lie waiting on my <span class="smcap">Lord Cardinal</span>,
whose hours I must observe to be always at hand, lest I
should be called when I am not by: the which should be taken
for a fault of great negligence. Wherefore, that I am now
well satiated with the beholding of these gay hangings, that
garnish here every wall, I will turn me and talk with you."
(<i>Exhortacion to yonge men</i>, fol. 39, rev.) Dr. Wordsworth,
in the first volume of his <i>Ecclesiastical Biography</i>, has
printed, for the first time, the genuine text of Cavendish's
interesting life of his reverend master, Wolsey. It is well
worth perusal. But the reader, I fear, is beginning to be
outrageous (having kept his patience, during this
long-winded note, to the present moment) for some
<i>bibliomaniacal</i> evidence of Wolsey's attachment to gorgeous
books. He is presented, therefore, with the following case
in point. My friend Mr. Ellis, of the British Museum,
informs me that, in the splendid library of that
establishment, there are two copies of Galen's "<i>Methodus
Medendi</i>," edited by Linacre, and printed at Paris, in
folio, 1519. One copy, which belonged to Henry the Eighth,
has an illuminated title, with the royal arms at the bottom
of the title-page. The other, which is also illuminated, has
the cardinal's cap in the same place, above an empty shield.
Before the dedication to the king, in the latter copy,
Linacre has inserted an elegant Latin epistle to <span class="smcap">Wolsey</span>, in
manuscript. The king's copy is rather the more beautiful of
the two: but the <i>unique</i> appendage of the Latin epistle
shews that the editor considered the cardinal a more
distinguished bibliomaniac than the monarch.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">We have now reached the <span class="smcap">Reformation</span>; upon which, as Burnet, Collier,
and Strype, have written huge folio volumes, it shall be my object to
speak sparingly: and chiefly as it concerns the history of the
Bibliomania. A word or two, however, about its origin, spirit, and
tendency.</p>

<p class="bp">It seems to have been at first very equivocal, with Henry the Eighth,
whether he would take any decisive measures in the affair, or not. He
hesitated, resolved, and hesitated again.<a name="FNanchor_303_307" id="FNanchor_303_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_307" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> The creature of caprice
and tyranny, he had neither fixed principles, nor settled data, upon
which to act. If he had listened to the temperate advice of <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>
or <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>,<a name="FNanchor_304_308" id="FNanchor_304_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_308" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span> have attained his darling object by less
decisive, but certainly by more justifiable, means. Those able and
respectable counsellors saw clearly that violent measures would
produce violent results; and that a question of law, of no mean
magnitude, was involved in the very outset of the transaction&mdash;for
there seemed, on the one side, no right to possess; and, on the other,
no right to render possession.<a name="FNanchor_305_309" id="FNanchor_305_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_309" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_303_307" id="Footnote_303_307"></a><a href="#FNanchor_303_307">[303]</a> "The king seemed to think that his subjects
owed an entire resignation of their reasons and consciences
to him; and, as he was highly offended with those who still
adhered to the papal authority, so he could not bear the
haste that some were making to a further reformation, before
or beyond his allowance. So, in the end of the year 1538, he
set out a proclamation, in which he prohibits the importing
of all foreign books, or the printing of any at home without
license; and the printing of any parts of the scripture,
'till they were examined by the king and his council," &amp;c.
"He requires that none may argue against the presence of
Christ in the Sacrament, under the pain of death, and of the
loss of their goods; and orders all to be punished who did
disuse any rites or ceremonies not then abolished; yet he
orders them only to be observed without superstition, only
as remembrances, and not to repose in them a trust of
salvation."&mdash;Burnet's <i>Hist. of the Reformation</i>. But long
before this obscure and arbitrary act was passed, Henry's
mind had been a little shaken against papacy from a singular
work, published by one Fish, called "<i>The Supplication of
Beggers</i>." Upon this book being read through in the presence
of Henry, the latter observed, shrewdly enough, "If a man
should pull down an old stone wall, and begin at the lower
part, the upper part thereof might chance to fall upon his
head." "And then he took the book, and put it into his desk,
and commanded them, upon their allegiance, that they should
not tell to any man that he had seen this book." Fox's <i>Book
of Martyrs</i>; vol. ii., p. 280: edit. 1641. Sir Thomas More
answered this work (which depicted, in frightful colours,
the rapacity of the Roman Catholic clergy), in 1529; see my
edition of the latter's <i>Utopia</i>; vol. i., xciii.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_304_308" id="Footnote_304_308"></a><a href="#FNanchor_304_308">[304]</a> "These were some of the resolute steps King
Henry made towards the obtaining again this long struggled
for, and almost lost, right and prerogative of kings, in
their own dominions, of being supreme, against the
encroachments of the bishops of Rome. Secretary <span class="smcap">Cromwel</span> had
the great stroke in all this. All these counsels and methods
were struck out of his head." Strype's <i>Ecclesiastical
Memorials</i>; vol. i., p. 205. When great murmurs ensued, on
the suppression of the monasteries, because of the cessation
of hospitality exercised in them, "<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> advised the king
to sell their lands, at very easie rates, to the gentry in
the several counties, obliging them, since they had them
upon such terms, to keep up the wonted hospitality. This
drew in the gentry apace," &amp;c. Burnet's <i>Hist. of the
Reformation</i>; vol. i., p. 223. "<span class="smcap">Archbishop Cranmer</span> is said
to have counselled and pressed the king to dissolve the
monasteries; but for other ends (than those of personal
enmity against 'the monks or friars'&mdash;or of enriching
himself 'with the spoils' of the same); viz. that, out of
the revenues of these monasteries, the king might found more
bishoprics; and that dioceses, being reduced into less
compass, the diocesans might the better discharge their
office, according to the scripture and primitive
rules.&mdash;&mdash;And the archbishop hoped that, from these ruins,
there would be new foundations in every cathedral erected,
to be nurseries of learning for the use of the whole
diocese." Strype's <i>Life of Archbishop Cranmer</i>, p. 35.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_305_309" id="Footnote_305_309"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305_309">[305]</a> "A very rational doubt yet remained, how
religious persons could alienate and transfer to the king a
property, of which they themselves were only tenants for
life: and an act of parliament was framed in order to remove
all future scruples on this head, and 'settle rapine and
sacrilege,' as Lord Herbert terms them, 'on the king and his
heirs for ever.'&mdash;&mdash;It does not appear to have been debated,
in either house, whether they had a power to dispossess some
hundred thousand persons of their dwellings and fortunes,
whom, a few years before, they had declared to be good
subjects: if such as live well come under that
denomination."&mdash;"Now," says Sir Edward Coke, "observe the
conclusion of this tragedy. In that very parliament, when
the great and opulent priory of St. John of Jerusalem was
given to the king, and which was the last monastery seized
on, he demanded a fresh subsidy of the clergy and laity: he
did the same again within two years; and again three years
after; and since the dissolution exacted great loans, and
against law obtained them."&mdash;<i>Life of Reginald Pole</i>; vol.
i., p. 247-9: edit. 1767, 8vo. Coke's 4th <i>Institute</i>, fol.

<p class="tbp"><span class="smcap">Latimer</span>, more hasty and enthusiastic than his episcopal brethren, set
all the engines of his active mind to work, as if to carry the point
by a <i>coup de main</i>; and although his resolution was, perhaps, upon
more than one occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>sion, shaken by the sufferings of the innocent,
yet, by his example, and particularly by his sermons,<a name="FNanchor_306_310" id="FNanchor_306_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_310" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> he tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
to exasperate every Protestant bosom against the occupiers of
monasteries and convents.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_306_310" id="Footnote_306_310"></a><a href="#FNanchor_306_310">[306]</a> "It was once moved by <span class="smcap">Latymer</span>, the good
bishop of Worcester, that two or three of these foundations
might be spared in each diocese, for the sake of
hospitality. Which gave the foresaid bishop occasion to move
the Lord Crumwell once in the behalf of the <i>Priory of
Malvern</i>." Strype's <i>Ecclesiastical Memorials</i>, vol. i.,
259. Latimer's letter is here printed; and an interesting
one it is. Speaking of the prior, he tells Cromwell that
"The man is old, a good housekeeper, feedeth many; and that,
daily. For the country is poor, and full of penury." But the
hospitality and infirmities of this poor prior were less
likely to operate graciously upon the rapacious mind of
Henry than "the 500 marks to the king, and 200 marks more to
the said Lord Crumwell," which he tendered at the same time.
See Strype, <i>ibid.</i> For the credit of Latimer, I hope this
worthy prior was not at the head of the priory when the
former preached before the king, and thus observed: "To let
pass the <i>solempne</i> and nocturnal bacchanals, the prescript
miracles, that are done upon certain days in the West part
of England, who hath not heard? I think ye have heard of
Saint <i>Blesis's</i> heart, which is <i>at Malvern</i>, and of Saint
Algar's bones, how long they deluded the people!" See
Latimer's <i>Sermons</i>: edit. 1562, 4to.: fol. 12, rect. In
these Sermons, as is justly said above, there are many
cutting philippics&mdash;especially against "in-preaching
prelates;" some of whom Latimer doth not scruple to call
"minters&mdash;dancers&mdash;crouchers&mdash;pamperers of their paunches,
like a monk that maketh his jubilee&mdash;mounchers in their
mangers, and moilers in their gay manors and mansions:" see
fol. 17, rect. Nevertheless, there are few productions which
give us so lively and interesting a picture of the manners
of the age as the <span class="smcap">sermons of Latimer</span>; which were spoilt in
an "<i>editio castrata</i>" that appeared in the year 1788, 8vo.
But Latimer was not the only popular preacher who directed
his anathemas against the Roman Catholic clergy. The well
known <span class="smcap">John Fox</span> entered into the cause of the reformation
with a zeal and success of which those who have slightly
perused his compositions can have but a very inadequate
idea. The following curious (and I may add very interesting)
specimen of Fox's pulpit eloquence is taken from "<i>A Sermon
of Christ crucified, preached at Paule's Crosse, the Friday
before Easter, commonly called Good Fridaie</i>:"&mdash;"Let me tell
you a story, which I remember was done about the beginning
of Queen Mary's reign, anno 1554. There was a certain
message sent, not from heaven, but from Rome: not from God,
but from the pope: not by any apostle, but by a certain
cardinal, who was called Cardinal Poole, Legatus a latere,
Legatus natus, a legate from the pope's own white side, sent
hither into England. This cardinal legate, first coming to
Dover, was honourably received and brought to Greenwich:
where he again, being more honourably received by lords of
high estate, and of the Privy Council (of whom some are yet
alive) was conducted thence to the privy stairs of the
queen's court at Westminster, no less person than King
Philip himself waiting upon him, and receiving him; and so
was brought to the queen's great chamber, she then being, or
else pretending, not to be well at ease. Stephen Gardiner,
the bishop of Winchester, and Lord Chancellor of England,
receiving this noble legate in the king and the queen's
behalf, to commend and set forth the authority of this
legate, the greatness of his message, and the supreme
majesty of the sender, before the public audience of the
whole parliament at that time assembled, there openly
protested, with great solemnity of words, what a mighty
message, and of what great importance was then brought into
the realm, even the greatest message (said he) that ever
came into England, and therefore desired them to give
attentive and inclinable ears to such a famous legation,
sent from so high authority." "Well, and what message was
this? forsooth, that the realm of England should be
reconciled again unto their father the pope; that is to say,
that the queen, with all her nobility and sage council, with
so many learned prelates, discreet lawyers, worthy commons,
and the whole body of the realm of England, should captive
themselves, and become underlings to an Italian stranger,
and friarly priest, sitting in Rome, which never knew
England, never was here, never did, or shall do, England
good. And this forsooth (said Gardiner) was the greatest
ambassage, the weightiest legacy that ever came to England:
forgetting belike either this message of God, sent here by
his apostles unto vs, or else because he saw it made not so
much for his purpose as did the other, he made the less
account thereof." "Well, then, and will we see what a
weighty message this was that Gardiner so exquisitely
commended? first, the sender is gone, the messenger is gone,
the queen is gone, and the message gone, and yet England
standeth not a rush the better. Of which message I thus say,
answering again to Gardiner, <i>per inversionem Rhetoricam</i>,
that, as he sayeth, it was the greatest&mdash;so I say again, it
was the lightest&mdash;legacy; the most ridiculous trifle, and
most miserablest message, of all other that ever came, or
ever shall come, to England, none excepted, for us to be
reconciled to an outlandish priest, and to submit our necks
under a foreign yoke. What have we to do more with him than
with the great Calypha of Damascus? If reconciliation ought
to follow, where offences have risen, the pope hath offended
us more than his coffers are able to make us amends. We
never offended him. But let the pope, with his
reconciliation and legates, go, as they are already gone
(God be thanked): and I beseech God so they may be gone,
that they never come here again. England never fared better
than when the pope did most curse it. And yet I hear
whispering of certain privy reconcilers, sent of late by the
pope, which secretly creep in corners. But this I leave to
them that have to do with all. Let us again return to our
matter."&mdash;<i>Imprinted by Jhon Daie</i>, &amp;c., 1575, 8vo., sign.

<p class="tbp">With Henry, himself, the question of spiritual supremacy was soon
changed, or merged (as the lawyers call it) into the exclusive

execution the examination of the monasteries, was a Dr.
London; who "was afterwards not only a persecutor of
Protestants, but a suborner of false witnesses against them,
and was now zealous even to officiousness in suppressing the
monasteries. He also studied to frighten the abbess of
Godstow into a resignation. She was particularly in
Cromwell's favour:" &amp;c. Burnet: <i>Hist. of the Reformation</i>,
vol. iii., p. 132. Among Burnet's "Collection of Records,"
is the letter of this said abbess, in which she tells
Cromwell that "Doctor London was suddenly <i>cummyd</i> unto her,
with a great rout with him; and there did threaten her and
her sisters, saying that he had the king's commission to
suppress the house, spite of her teeth. And when he saw that
she was content that he should do all things according to
his commission, and shewed him plain that she would never
surrender to his band, being her ancient enemy&mdash;then he
began to entreat her and to inveigle her sisters, one by
one, otherwise than ever she heard tell that any of the
king's subjects had been handel'd;" vol. iii., p. 130.
"Collection." It is not very improbable that this treatment
of Godstow nunnery formed a specimen of many similar
visitations. As to London himself, he ended his days in the
Fleet, after he had been adjudged to ride with his face to
the horse's tail, at Windsor and Oakingham. Fox in his <i>Book
of Martyrs</i>, has given us a print of this transaction;
sufficiently amusing. Dod, in his <i>Church History</i>, vol. i.,
p. 220, has of course not spared Dr. London. But see, in
particular, Fuller's shrewd remarks upon the character of

monasteries, which were sufficiently wealthy; but he has not
noticed that of St. Swithin's in Winchester&mdash;of which Strype
has given so minute and interesting an inventory. A lover of
old coins and relics may feed his imagination with a
gorgeous picture of what might have been the "massive silver
and golden crosses and shrines garnished with stones"&mdash;but a
tender-hearted bibliomaniac will shed tears of agony on
thinking of the fate of "<span class="smcap">a book of the four evangelists,

<p><a name="Footnote_309_313" id="Footnote_309_313"></a><a href="#FNanchor_309_313">[309]</a> The amiable and candid Strype has polluted
the pages of his valuable <i>Ecclesiastical Memorials</i> with an
account of such horrid practices, supposed to have been
carried on in monasteries, as must startle the most
credulous Anti-Papist; and which almost leads us to conclude
that <i>a legion of fiends</i> must have been let loose upon
these "Friar Rushes!" The author tells us that he takes his
account from authentic documents&mdash;but these documents turn
out to be the letters of the visitors; and of the character
of one of these the reader has just had a sufficient proof.
Those who have the work here referred to, vol. i., p. 256-7,
may think, with the author of it, that "this specimen is
enough and too much." What is a little to be marvelled at,
Strype suffers his prejudices against the conduct of the
monks to be heightened by a letter from one of the name of
Beerly, at Pershore; who, in order that he might escape the
general wreck, turned tail upon his brethren, and vilified
them as liberally as their professed enemies had done. Now,
to say the least, this was not obtaining what Chief Baron
Gilbert, in his famous Law of Evidence, has laid it down as
necessary to be obtained&mdash;"the best possible evidence that
the nature of the case will admit of." It is worth remarking
that Fuller has incorporated a particular account of the
names of the abbots and of the carnal enormities of which
they are supposed to have been guilty; but he adds that he
took it from the 3d edition of Speed's <i>Hist. of Great
Britain</i>, and (what is worth special notice) that it was not
to be found in the prior ones: "being a posthume addition
after the author's death, attested in the margine with the
authority of Henry Steven his <i>Apologie for Herodotus</i>, who
took the same out of an English book, containing the
<i>Vileness discovered at the Visitation of Monasteries</i>."

<p class="tbp">A pause perhaps of one moment might have ensued. A consideration of
what had been done, in these monasteries, for the preservation of the
literature of past ages, and for the cultivation of elegant and
peaceful pursuits, might, like "the still small voice" of conscience,
have suspended, for a second, the final sentence of confiscation. The
hospitality for which the owners of these places had been, and were
then, eminently distinguished; but more especially the yet higher
consideration of their property having been left with them only as a
sacred pledge to be handed down, unimpaired, to their
successors&mdash;these things,<a name="FNanchor_310_314" id="FNanchor_310_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_314" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> one would think, might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span> infused
some little mercy and moderation into Henry's decrees!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_310_314" id="Footnote_310_314"></a><a href="#FNanchor_310_314">[310]</a> There are two points, concerning the
subversion of monasteries, upon which all sensible Roman
Catholics make a rest, and upon which they naturally indulge
a too well-founded grief. The dispersion of books or
interruption of study; and the breaking up of ancient
hospitality. Let us hear Collier upon the subject: "The
advantages accruing to the public from these religious
houses were considerable, upon several accounts. To mention
some of them: The temporal nobility and gentry had a
creditable way of providing for their younger children.
Those who were disposed to withdraw from the world, or not
likely to make their fortunes in it, had a handsome retreat
to the cloister. Here they were furnished with conveniences
for life and study, with opportunities for thought and
recollection; and, over and above, passed their time in a
condition not unbecoming their quality."&mdash;"The abbies were
very serviceable places for the education of young people:
every convent had one person or more assigned for this
business. Thus the children of the neighbourhood were taught
grammar and music without any charge to their parents. And,
in the nunneries, those of the other sex learned to work and
read English, with some advances into Latin," &amp;c.&mdash;"Farther,
it is to the abbies we are obliged for most of our
historians, both of church and state: these places of
retirement had both most learning and leisure for such
undertakings: neither did they want information for such
employment," <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, vol. ii., 165. A host
of Protestant authors, with Lord Herbert at the head of
them, might be brought forward to corroborate these sensible
remarks of Collier. The hospitality of the monastic life has
been on all sides admitted; and, according to Lord Coke, one
of the articles of impeachment against Cardinal Wolsey was
that he had caused "this hospitality and relief to grow into
decay and disuse;" which was "a great cause that there were
so many vagabonds, beggars, and thieves;"&mdash;<i>Fourth
Institute</i>; p. 91, edit. 1669. So that the author of an
ancient, and now rarely perused work had just reason, in
describing the friars of his time as "living in common upon
the goods of a monastery, either gotten by common labour, or
else upon lands and possessions where with the monastery was
endowed." <i>Pype or Tonne of the Lyfe of Perfection</i>; fol.
clxxii., rev. 1532, 4to. And yet, should the active
bibliomaniac be disposed to peruse this work, after
purchasing Mr. Triphook's elegant copy of the same, he might
probably not think very highly of the author's good sense,
when he found him gravely telling us that "the appetite of
clean, sweet, and fair, or fine cloaths, and oft-washing and
curious <i>pykyng</i> of the body, is an enemy of chastity," fol.
ccxxix. rect. The <span class="smcap">devastation of books</span> was, I fear,
sufficiently frightful to warrant the following writers in
their respective conclusions. "A judicious author (says
Ashmole) speaking of the dissolution of our monasteries,
saith thus: Many manuscripts, guilty of no other
superstition then (having) <i>red letters</i> in the front, were
condemned to the fire: and here a principal key of antiquity
was lost, to the great prejudice of posterity. Indeed (such
was learning's misfortune, at that great devastation of our
English libraries, that) where a <i>red letter</i> or a
mathematical diagram appeared, they were sufficient to
entitle the book to be popish or diabolical." <i>Theatrum
Chemicum</i>; prolegom. A. 2. rev. "The avarice of the late
intruders was so mean, and their ignorance so
undistinguishing, that, when the books happened to have
<span class="smcap">costly covers</span>, they tore them off, and threw away the works,
or turned them to the vilest purposes." <i>Life of Reginald
Pole</i>; vol. i., p. 253-4, edit. 1767, 8vo. The author of
this last quotation then slightly notices what Bale has said
upon these book-devastations; and which I here subjoin at
full length; from my first edition of this work:&mdash;"Never
(says Bale) had we been offended for the loss of our
<span class="smcap">libraries</span>, being so many in number, and in so desolate
places for the more part, if the chief monuments and most
notable works of our excellent writers had been preserved.
If there had been, in every shire of England, but one
<span class="smcap">solempne library</span>, to the preservation of those noble works,
and preferment of good learning in our posterity, it had
been yet somewhat. But to destroy all, without
consideration, is, and will be, unto England, for ever, a
most horrible infamy among the grave seniors of other
nations. A great number of them, which purchased those
superstitious mansions, reserved of those library-books some
to serve the <i>jakes</i>, some to scour their candlesticks, and
some to rub their boots: some they sold to the grocers and
soap sellers; some they sent over sea to the book-binders,
not in small number, but at times whole ships full, to the
wondering of the foreign nations. Yea, the Universities of
the realm are not all clear of this detestable fact. But
cursed is that belly which seeketh to be fed with such
ungodly gains, and shameth his natural country. I know a
merchant man, which shall at this time be nameless, that
<i>bought the contents of two noble libraries for forty
shillings price</i>; a shame it is to be spoken! This stuff
hath he occupied in the stead of grey paper, by the space of
more than ten years, and yet he hath store enough for as
many years to come!" Preface to <i>Leland's Laboryouse
Journey</i>, &amp;c., 1549, 8vo. Reprint of 1772; sign. C.</p>

months. Mary next ascended the throne; and the storm took an opposite
direction. Then an attempt was made to restore chalices, crucifixes,
and missals. But the short period of her sovereignty making way for

Walsinghams<a name="FNanchor_313_317" id="FNanchor_313_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_317" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> united their great talents with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span> equally vigorous

But, from the foregoing premises, the reader may probably be
disposed to admit the conclusion of a virulent Roman
Catholic writer, even in its fullest extent: namely, that
there were "subverted monasteries, overthrown abbies, broken

<p><a name="Footnote_313_317" id="Footnote_313_317"></a><a href="#FNanchor_313_317">[313]</a> There are few bibliographers at all versed in
English literature and history, who have not heard, by some
side wind or other, of the last mentioned work; concerning
which Herbert is somewhat interesting in his notes:
<i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, vol. iii., p. 1630. The reader
is here presented with a copious extract from this curious
and scarce book&mdash;not for the sake of adding to these
ponderous notes relating to the <span class="smcap">Reformation</span>&mdash;(a subject,
upon which, from a professional feeling, I thought it my
duty to say something!)&mdash;but for the sake of showing how
dexterously the most important events and palpable truths
may be described and perverted by an artful and headstrong
disputant. The work was written expressly to defame
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, <span class="smcap">Cecil</span>, and <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, and to introduce the Romish
religion upon the ruins of the Protestant. The author thus
gravely talks</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Of Queen Mary and her Predecessors.</i></p>

<p>"She (Mary) found also the whole face of the commonwealth
settled and acquieted in the ancient religion; in which, and
by which, all kings and queens of that realm (from as long
almost before the conquest as that conquest was before that
time) had lived, reigned, and maintained their states; and
the terrible correction of those few that swerved from it
notorious, as no man could be ignorant of it. As King John,
without error in religion, for contempt only of the See
Apostolic, plagued with the loss of his state, till he
reconciled himself, and acknowledged to hold his crown of
the Pope. King Henry VIII., likewise, with finding no end of
heading and hanging, till (with the note of tyranny for
wasting his nobility) he had headed him also that procured
him to it. Fol. 85, 86.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Libellous Character of Cecil.</i></p>

<p>"In which stem and trunk (being rotten at heart, hollow
within, and without sound substance) hath our spiteful
pullet (<span class="smcap">Cecil</span>) laid her ungracious eggs, mo than a few: and
there hath hatched sundry of them, and brought forth
chickens of her own feather, I warrant you. A hen I call
him, as well for his cackling, ready and smooth tongue,
wherein he giveth place to none, as for his deep and subtle
art in hiding his serpentine eggs from common men's sight:
chiefly for his hennish heart and courage, which twice
already hath been well proved to be as base and deject at
the sight of any storm of adverse fortune, as ever was hen's
heart at the sight of a fox. And, had he not been by his
confederate, as with a dunghill cock, trodden as it were and
gotten with egg, I doubt whether ever his hennish heart,
joined to his shrewd wit, would have served him, so soon to
put the Q.'s green and tender state in so manifest peril and
adventure. Fol. 88, rect.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Libellous Characters of Cecil and N. Bacon.</i></p>

<p>"Let the houses and possessions of these two Catalines be
considered, let their furniture, and building, let their
daily purchases, and ready hability to purchase still, let
their offices and functions wherein they sit, let their
titles, and styles claimed and used, let their places in
council, let their authority over the nobility, let their
linking in alliance with the same, let their access to the
prince, let their power and credit with her: let this their
present state, I say, in all points (being open and unknown
to no men) be compared with their base parentage and
progeny, (the one raised out of the robes, and the other
from a <i>Sheeprive's</i> son) and let that give sentence as well
of the great difference of the tastes, that the several
fruits gathered of this tree by your Q., and by them do
yield, as whether any man at this day approach near unto
them in any condition wherein advancement consisteth. Yea,
mark you the jollity and pride that in this prosperity they
shew; the port and countenance that every way they carry; in
comparison of them that be noble by birth. Behold at whose
doors your nobility attendeth. Consider in whose chambers
your council must sit, and to whom for resolutions they must
resort; and let these things determine both what was the
purpose indeed, and hidden intention of that change of
religion, and who hath gathered the benefits of that
mutation: that is to say, whether for your Q., for your
realms, or for their own sakes, the same at first was taken
in hand, and since pursued as you have seen. For according
to the principal effects of every action must the intent of
the act be deemed and presumed. For the objected excuses
(that they did it for conscience, or for fear of the French)
be too frivolous and vain to abuse any wise man. For they
that under King Henry were as catholic, as the six articles
required: that under King Edward were such Protestants as
the Protector would have them; that under Q. Mary were
Catholics again, even to creeping to the Cross: and that
under Q. Elizabeth were first Lutheran, setting up Parker,
Cheiny, Gest, Bill, &amp;c., then Calvinists, advancing
Grindall, Juell, Horne, &amp;c.: then Puritans, maintaining
Sampson, Deering, Humfrey, &amp;c.; and now (if not Anabaptists
and Arians) plain Machiavellians, yea, that they persuade in
public speeches that man hath free liberty to dissemble his
religion, and for authority do allege their own examples and
practice of feigning one religion for another in Q. Mary's
time (which containeth a manifest evacuation of Christ's own
coming and doctrine, of the Apostles, preaching and
practice, of the blood of the martyrs, of the constancy of
all confessors; yea, and of the glorious vain deaths of all
the stinking martyrs of their innumerable sects of
hereticks, one and other having always taught the confession
of mouth to be as necessary to salvation as the belief of
heart): shall these men now be admitted to plead conscience
in religion; and can any man now be couzined so much, as to
think that these men by conscience were then moved to make
that mutation?" Fol. 96, 97. "At home, likewise, apparent it
is how they provided, every way to make themselves strong
there also. For being by their own marriages allied already
to the house of Suffolk of the blood royal, and by
consequence thereof to the house of Hertford also, and their
children thereby incorporated to both: mark you how now by
marriage of their children with wily wit and wealth
together, they wind in your other noblest houses unto them
that are left, I mean in credit and countenance. Consider
likewise how, at their own commendation and preferment, they
have erected, as it were, almost a new half of your nobility
(of whom also they have reason to think themselves assured)
and the rest then (that were out of hope to be won to their
faction) behold how, by sundry fine devices, they are either
cut off, worn out, fled, banished or defaced at home," &amp;c.,
fol. 105, rect. The good <span class="smcap">Lord Burghley</span>, says Strype, was so
moved at this slander that he uttered these words: "God
amend his spirit, and confound his malice." And by way of
protestation of the integrity and faithfulness of both their
services, "God send this estate no worse meaning servants,
in all respects, than we two have been." <i>Annals of the

<p>At the sale of Mr. Brand's books, in 1807, a copy of this
rare tract, of six or seven pages, was sold for 3<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> Vide <i>Bibl. Brand</i>, part i., n<span class="super">o</span>. 1300. This was
surely more than both plaister and horse were worth! A
poetical satire of a similar kind, entitled "<i>John Bon and
Mast Person</i>," was printed by Daye and Seres; who struck off
but a few copies, but who were brought into considerable
trouble for the same. The virulence with which the author
and printer of this lampoon were persecuted in Mary's reign
is sufficiently attested by the care which was taken to
suppress every copy that could be secured. The only perfect
known copy of this rare tract was purchased at the sale of
Mr. R. Forster's books, for the Marquis of Bute; and Mr.
Stace, the bookseller, had privilege to make a fac-simile
reprint of it; of which there were six copies struck off
<span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>. It being now rather common with
book-collectors, there is no necessity to make a quotation
from it here. Indeed there is very little in it deserving of
republication.</p>

See Warton's <i>Life of Sir Thomas Pope</i>: p. 166, note o., ed.

wearing whistles, among noblemen, at the commencement of the

the express order of Henry VIII.; and seems in every respect (if we
may credit the apparently frank testimony of his son<a name="FNanchor_320_325" id="FNanchor_320_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_325" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>), to have

</div>

<p class="tbp">But it is time to introduce your favourite <span class="smcap">Leland</span>: a bibliomaniac of
unparalleled powers and unperishable fame. To entwine the wreath of
praise round the brow of this great man seems to have been considered
by Bale among the most exquisite gratifications of his existence. It
is with no small delight, therefore, Lorenzo, that I view, at this
distance, the marble bust of Leland in yonder niche of your library,
with a laureate crown upon its pedestal. And with almost equal
satisfaction did I observe, yesterday, during the absence of Philemon
and Lisardo at the book-sale, the handsome manner in which
Harrison,<a name="FNanchor_321_326" id="FNanchor_321_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_326" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> in his <i>Description of England</i>, prefixed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Holinshed's Chronicles, has spoken of this illustrious antiquary. No
delays, no difficulties, no perils, ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span> daunted his personal
courage, or depressed his mental energies. Enamoured of study, to the
last rational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span> moment of his existence, Leland seems to have been born
for the "Laborious Journey" which he undertook in search of truth, as
she was to be discovered among mouldering records, and worm-eaten
volumes. Uniting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span> the active talents of a statist with the painful
research of an antiquary, he thought nothing too insignificant for
observation. The confined streamlet or the capacious river&mdash;the
obscure village or the populous town&mdash;were, with parchment rolls and
oaken-covered books, alike objects of curiosity in his philosophic
eye! Peace to his once vexed spirit!&mdash;and never-fading honours attend
the academical society in which his youthful mind was disciplined to
such laudable pursuits!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_321_326" id="Footnote_321_326"></a><a href="#FNanchor_321_326">[321]</a> "One helpe, and none of the smallest, that I
obtained herein, was by such commentaries as <span class="smcap">Leland</span> had
sometime collected of the state of Britaine; books vtterlie
mangled, defaced with wet and weather, and finallie
vnperfect through want of sundrie volumes." <i>Epistle
Dedicatorie</i>; vol. i., p. vi., edit. 1807. The history of
this great man, and of his literary labours, is most
interesting. He was a pupil of William Lilly, the first
head-master of St. Paul's school; and, by the kindness and
liberality of a Mr. Myles, he afterwards received the
advantage of a college education, and was supplied with
money in order to travel abroad, and make such collections
as he should deem necessary for the great work which even
then seemed to dawn upon his young and ardent mind. Leland
endeavoured to requite the kindness of his benefactor by an
elegant copy of Latin verses, in which he warmly expatiates
on the generosity of his patron, and acknowledges that his
acquaintance with the <i>Almæ Matres</i> (for he was of both
Universities) was entirely the result of such beneficence.
While he resided on the continent, he was admitted into the
society of the most eminent Greek and Latin scholars, and
could probably number among his correspondents the
illustrious names of Budæus, Erasmus, the Stephenses, Faber
and Turnebus. Here, too, he cultivated his natural taste for
poetry; and, from inspecting the <span class="smcap">fine books</span> which the
Italian and French presses had produced, as well as fired by
the love of Grecian learning, which had fled, on the sacking
of Constantinople, to take shelter in the academic bowers of
the Medici&mdash;he seems to have matured his plans for carrying
into effect the great work which had now taken full
possession of his mind. He returned to England, resolved to
institute an inquiry into the state of the <span class="smcap">Libraries</span>,
<span class="smcap">Antiquities</span>, <span class="smcap">Records</span>, and <span class="smcap">Writings</span> then in existence. Having
entered into holy orders, and obtained preferment at the
express interposition of the king (Henry VIII.), he was
appointed his antiquary and library-keeper; and a royal
commission was issued, in which Leland was directed to
search after "<span class="smcap">England's Antiquities</span>, and peruse the
libraries of all cathedrals, abbies, priories, colleges,
&amp;c., as also all the places wherein records, writings, and
secrets of antiquity were reposited." "Before Leland's
time," says Hearne&mdash;in a strain which makes one
shudder&mdash;"all the literary monuments of antiquity were
totally disregarded; and students of Germany, apprized of
this culpable indifference, were suffered to enter our
libraries unmolested, and to cut out of the books, deposited
there, whatever passages they thought proper&mdash;which they
afterwards published as relics of the ancient literature of
their own country." <i>Pref. to the Itinerary.</i> Leland was
occupied, without intermission, in his laborious
undertaking, for the space of six years; and, on its
completion, he hastened to the metropolis to lay at the feet
of his sovereign the result of his researches. As John Kay
had presented his translation of the <i>Siege of Rhodes</i> to
Edward IV., as "<span class="smcap">a gift</span> of his labour," so Leland presented
his Itinerary to Henry VIII., under the title of <i>A New
Year's Gift</i>; and it was first published as such by Bale in
1549, 8vo. "Being inflamed," says the author, "with a love
to see thoroughly all those parts of your opulent and ample
realm, in so much that all my other occupations intermitted,
I have so travelled in your dominions both by the sea coasts
and the middle parts, sparing neither labour nor costs, by
the space of six years past, that there is neither cape nor
bay, haven, creek, or pier, river, or confluence of rivers,
breaches, wastes, lakes, moors, fenny waters, mountains,
valleys, heaths, forests, chases, woods, cities, burghes,
castles, principal manor places, monasteries, and colleges,
but I have seen them; and noted, in so doing, a whole world
of things very memorable." Leland moreover tells his
majesty&mdash;that "By his laborious journey and costly
enterprise, he had conserved many good authors, the which
otherwise had been like to have perished; of the which part
remained in the royal palaces, part also in his own
custody," &amp;c. As Leland was engaged six years in this
literary tour, so he was occupied for a no less period of
time in digesting and arranging the prodigious number of
MSS. which he had collected. But he sunk beneath the
immensity of the task. The want of amanuenses, and of other
attentions and comforts, seems to have deeply affected him.
In this melancholy state, he wrote to Archbishop Cranmer a
Latin epistle, in verse, of which the following is the
commencement&mdash;very forcibly describing his situation and
anguish of mind:</p>

<table style="width: 80%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">
<tr>
<td>
Est congesta mihi domi supellex<br />
Ingens, aurea, nobilis, venusta,<br />
Qua totus studeo Britanniarum<br />

Sed fortuna meis noverca c&#339;ptis<br />
Jam felicibus invidet maligna.</td>
<td>Quare, ne pereant brevi vel hora<br />

<span class="smcap">Cranmere</span>, eximium decus priorum!<br />
Implorare tuam benignitatem<br />
Cogor.<br />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The result was that Leland lost his senses; and, after
lingering two years in a state of total derangement, he died
on the 18th of April, 1552. "Prôh tristes rerum humanarum
vices! prôh viri optimi deplorandam infelicissimamque
sortem!" exclaims Dr. Smith, in his preface to Camden's
Life, 1691, 4to. The precious and voluminous MSS. of Leland
were doomed to suffer a fate scarcely less pitiable
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: than">that</span> that of their owner. After being
pilfered by some, and garbled by others, they served to
replenish the pages of Stow, Lambard, Camden, Burton,
Dugdale, and many other antiquaries and historians.
"Leland's Remains," says Bagford, "have been ever since a
standard to all that have any way treated of the Antiquities
of England. Reginald Wolfe intended to have made use of
them, although this was not done 'till after his death by
Harrison, Holinshed, and others concerned in that work.
Harrison transcribed his Itinerary, giving a Description of
England by the rivers, but he did not understand it. They
have likewise been made use of by several in part, but how
much more complete had this been, had it been finished by
himself?" <i>Collectanea</i>: Hearne's edit., 1774; vol. i., p.
<span class="smcap">lxxvii.</span> Polydore Virgil, who had stolen from these Remains
pretty freely, had the insolence to abuse Leland's
memory&mdash;calling him "a vain-glorious man;" but what shall we
say to this flippant egotist? who according to Caius's
testimony (<i>De Antiq. Cantab. Acad.</i>, lib. 1.) "to prevent a
discovery of the many errors of his own History of England,
collected and burnt a greater number of ancient histories
and manuscripts than would have loaded a waggon." There are
some (among whom I could number a most respectable friend
and well qualified judge) who have doubted of the propriety
of thus severely censuring Polydore Virgil; and who are even
sceptical about his malpractices. But Sir Henry Savile, who
was sufficiently contemporaneous to collect the best
evidence upon the subject, thus boldly observes: "Nam
Polydorus, ut homo Italus, et in rebus nostris hospes, et
(quod caput est) neque in republica versatus, nec magni
alioqui vel judicii vel ingenii, pauca ex multis delibans,
et falsa plerumque pro veris amplexus, historiam nobis
reliquit cum cætera mendosam tum exiliter sanè et jejunè
conscriptam." <i>Script. post. Bedam.</i>, edit. 1596; pref. "As
for Polydore Virgil, he hath written either nothing or very
little concerning them; and that so little, so false and
misbeseeming the ingenuitie of an historian, that he seemeth
to have aimed at no other end than, by bitter invectives
against Henry VIII., and Cardinal Wolsey, to demerit the
favour of Queen Mary," &amp;c., Godwyn's translation of the
<i>Annales of England</i>; edit. 1630, author's Preface. "It is
also remarkable that Polydore Virgil's and Bishop Joscelin's
edition of Gildas's epistle differ so materially that the
author of it hardly seems to be one and the same person."
This is Gale's opinion: <i>Rer. Anglican. Script. Vet.</i>; vol.
i., pref., p. 4. Upon the whole&mdash;to return to Leland&mdash;it
must be acknowledged that he is a melancholy, as well as
illustrious, example of the influence of the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>!
But do not let us take leave of him without a due
contemplation of his expressive features, as they are given
in the frontispiece of the first volume of the Lives of
Leland, Hearne, and Wood. 1772, 8vo.

<p class="tbp"><span class="smcap">Bale</span> follows closely after Leland. This once celebrated, and yet
respectable, writer had probably more zeal than discretion; but his
exertions in the cause of our own church can never be mentioned
without admiration. I would not, assuredly, quote Bale as a decisive
authority in doubtful or difficult cases;<a name="FNanchor_322_327" id="FNanchor_322_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_327" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> but, as he lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span> in
the times of which he in a great measure wrote, and as his society was
courted by the wealthy and powerful, I am not sure whether he merits
to be treated with the roughness with which some authors mention his
labours. He had, certainly, a tolerable degree of strength in his
English style; but he painted with a pencil which reminded us more
frequently of the horrific pictures of Spagnoletti than of the tender
compositions of Albano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span> That he idolized his master, Leland, so
enthusiastically, will always cover, in my estimation, a multitude of
his errors: and that he should leave a scholar's inventory (as Fuller
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: says">saps</span>), "more books than money behind him,"
will at least cause him to be numbered among the most renowned
bibliomaniacs.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_322_327" id="Footnote_322_327"></a><a href="#FNanchor_322_327">[322]</a> Like all men, who desert a religion which
they once enthusiastically profess, Bale, after being
zealous for the papal superstitions, holding up his hands to
rotten posts, and calling them his "fathers in heaven,"
(according to his own confession) became a zealous
Protestant, and abused the church of Rome with a virulence
almost unknown in the writings of his predecessors. But in
spite of his coarseness, positiveness, and severity, he
merits the great praise of having done much in behalf of the
cause of literature. His attachment to Leland is,
unquestionably, highly to his honour; but his biographies,
especially of the Romish prelates, are as monstrously
extravagant as his plays are incorrigibly dull. He had a
certain rough honesty and prompt benevolence of character,
which may be thought to compensate for his grosser failings.
His reputation as a <i>bibliomaniac</i> is fully recorded in the
anecdote mentioned at <a href="#Page_234">p. 234</a>, ante. His "magnum opus," the
<i>Scriptores Britanniæ</i>, has already been noticed with
sufficient minuteness; vide <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>, ante. It has not escaped
severe animadversion. Francis Thynne tells us that Bale has
"mistaken infynyte thinges in that booke de Scriptoribus
Anglie, being for the most part the collections of Lelande."
<i>Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer</i>; p. 23. Picard, in his
wretched edition of <i>Gulielmus Neubrigensis</i> (edit. 1610, p.
672), has brought a severe accusation against the author of
having "burnt or torn all the copies of the works which he
described, after he had taken the titles of them;" but see
this charge successfully rebutted in Dr. Pegge's
<i>Anonymiana</i>; p. 311. That Bale's library, especially in the
department of manuscripts, was both rich and curious, is
indisputable, from the following passage in <i>Strype's Life
of Archbishop Parker</i>. "The archbishop laid out for <span class="smcap">Bale's</span>
rare collection of MSS. immediately upon his death, fearing
that they might be gotten by somebody else. Therefore he
took care to bespeak them before others, and was promised to
have them for his money, as he told Cecil. And perhaps
divers of those books that do now make proud the University
Library, and that of Benet and some other colleges, in
Cambridge, were Bale's," p. 539. It would seem, from the
same authority, that our bibliomaniac "set himself to search
the libraries in Oxford, Cambridge, London (wherein there
was but one, and that a slender one), Norwich, and several
others in Norfolk and Suffolk: whence he had collected
enough for another volume De Scriptoribus Britannicis."
<i>Ibid.</i> The following very beautiful wood-cut of Bale's
portrait is taken from the original, of the same size, in
the <i>Acta Romanorum Pontificum</i>; Basil, 1527, 8vo. A similar
one, on a larger scale, will be found in the "<i>Scriptores</i>,"
&amp;c., published at Basil, 1557, or 1559&mdash;folio. Mr. Price,
the principal librarian of the Bodleian Library, shewed me a
rare head of Bale, of a very different cast of features&mdash;in
a small black-letter book, of which I have forgotten the
name.

<p class="tbp">Before I enter upon the reign of Elizabeth, let me pay a passing, but
sincere, tribute of respect to the memory of <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>; whose <i>Great
Bible</i><a name="FNanchor_323_328" id="FNanchor_323_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_328" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> is at once a monument of his attachment to the Protestant
religion, and to splendid books. His end was sufficiently lamentable;
but while the flames were consuming his parched body, and while his
right hand, extended in the midst of them, was reproached by him for

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_323_328" id="Footnote_323_328"></a><a href="#FNanchor_323_328">[323]</a> I have perused what Strype (<i>Life of
Cranmer</i>, pp. 59, 63, 444), Lewis (<i>History of English
Bibles</i>, pp. 122-137), Johnson (<i>Idem opus</i>, pp. 33-42), and
Herbert (<i>Typog. Antiquities</i>, vol. i., p. 513,) have
written concerning the biblical labours of Archbishop
Cranmer; but the accurate conclusion to be drawn about the
publication which goes under the name of <span class="smcap">Cranmer's</span>, or <span class="smcap">the
Great Bible</span>, <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 'is' missing in original">not</span>
quite so clear as bibliographers may imagine. However,
this is not the place to canvass so intricate a subject. It
is sufficient that a magnificent impression of the Bible in
the English language, with a superb frontispiece (which has
been most feebly and inadequately copied for Lewis's work),
under the archiepiscopal patronage of <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>, did make its
appearance in 1539: and it has been my good fortune to turn
over the leaves of the identical copy of it, printed <span class="smcap">upon
vellum</span>, concerning which Thomas Baker expatiates so
eloquently to his bibliomaniacal friend, Hearne. <i>Rob. of
Gloucester's Chronicle</i>; vol. i., p. xix. This copy is in
the library of St. John's College, Cambridge; and is now
placed upon a table, to the right hand, upon entering of the
same: although formerly, according to Bagford's account, it
was "among some old books in a private place nigh the
library." <i>Idem</i>; p. xxii. There is a similar copy in the
British Museum.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_324_329" id="Footnote_324_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_324_329">[324]</a> "And thus"&mdash;says Strype&mdash;(in a strain of
pathos and eloquence not usually to be found in his
writings) "we have brought this excellent prelate unto his
end, after two years and a half hard imprisonment. His body
was not carried to the grave in state, nor buried, as many
of his predecessors were, in his own cathedral church, nor
inclosed in a monument of marble or touchstone. Nor had he
any inscription to set forth his praises to posterity. No
shrine to be visited by devout pilgrims, as his
predecessors, S. Dunstan and S. Thomas had. Shall we
therefore say, as the poet doth:</p>

<p class="center">
Marmoreo Licinus tumulo jacet, at Cato parvo,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pompeius nullo. Quis putet esse Deos?</span><br />
</p>

<p>No; we are better Christians, I trust, than so: who are
taught, that the rewards of God's elect are not temporal but
eternal. And Cranmer's martyrdom is his monument, and his
name will outlast an epitaph or a shrine." <i>Life of
Cranmer</i>; p. 391. It would seem, from the same authority,
that <span class="smcap">Ridley</span>, <span class="smcap">Latimer</span>, and <span class="smcap">Cranmer</span>, were permitted to dine
together in prison, some little time before they suffered;
although they were "placed in separate lodgings that they
might not confer together." Strype saw "a book of their
diet, every dinner and supper, and the charge thereof,"&mdash;as
it was brought in by the bailiffs attending them.</p>

<p>I will draw the curtain upon this dismal picture, by a short
extract from one of Cranmer's letters, in which this great
and good man thus ingeniously urges the necessity of the
Scriptures being translated into the English language; a
point, by the bye, upon which neither he, nor Cromwell, nor
Latimer, I believe, were at first decided; "God's will and
commandment is, (says Cranmer) that when the people be
gathered together, the minister should use such language as
the people may understand, and take profit thereby; or else
hold their peace. For as an harp or lute, if it give no
certain sound that men may know what is stricken, who can
dance after it&mdash;for all the sound is vain; so is it vain and
profiteth nothing, sayeth Almighty God, by the mouth of St.
Paul, if the priest speak to the people in a language which
they know not." <i>Certain most godly, fruitful, and
comfortable letters of Saintes and holy Martyrs, &amp;c.</i>, 1564;
4to., fol. 8.</p>

Notwithstanding her earnestness to root out all relics of the Roman
Catholic religion (to which, as the best excuse, we must, perhaps,
attribute the sad cruelty of the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots), I
cannot in my heart forbear to think but
that she secured, for her own book-boudoir, one or two of the curious articles which the
commissioners often-times found in the libraries that they inspected:
and, amongst other volumes, how she could forbear pouncing upon "<i>A

Soul's College<a name="FNanchor_328_333" id="FNanchor_328_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_333" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>&mdash;is absolutely beyond my wit to divine!</p>

reader has already had some account (<a href="#Page_119">p. 119</a>, ante); but if
he wishes to enlarge his knowledge of the same, let him
refer to vol. lx. pt. ii. and vol. lxi. pt. i. of the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>. By the kindness of Mr. John Nichols,
I am enabled to present the bibliomaniacal virtuoso with a
fac-simile of the copper-plate inserted in the latter volume
(p. 321) of the authority last mentioned. It represents the
<span class="smcap">golden cover</span>, or binding, of this precious manuscript. Of
the Queen's attachment to works of this kind, the following
is a pretty strong proof: "In the Bodl. library, among the
MSS. in mus. num. 235, are the <i>Epistles of St. Paul, &amp;c.</i>,
printed in an old black letter in 12<span class="super">o</span>. which was <i>Queen
Elizabeth's own book</i>, and her own hand writing appears at
the beginning, viz.: "August. I walke many times into the
pleasant fieldes of the Holy Scriptures, where I plucke up
the goodliesome herbes of sentences by pruning: eate them by
reading: chawe them by musing: and laie them up at length in
the hie seate of memorie by gathering them together: that so
having tasted their sweetenes I may the lesse perceave the
bitterness of this miserable life." The covering is done in
needle work by the Queen [then princess] herself, and
thereon are these sentences, viz. on one side, on the
borders; <span class="smcap">celvm patria: scopvs vitæ xpvs. christvs via.
christo vive</span>. In the middle a heart, and round about it,
<span class="smcap">eleva cor svrsvm ibi vbi e.c.</span> [est Christus]. On the other
side, about the borders, <span class="smcap">beatvs qvi divitias scriptvræ

round it, <span class="smcap">vicit omnia pertinax virtvs</span> with <span class="smcap">e.c.</span>, <i>i.e.</i> as I
take it, <span class="smcap">elisabetha captiva</span>, or [provided it refer to
Virtus] <span class="smcap">elisabethæ captivæ</span>, she being, then, when she worked
this covering, a prisoner, if I mistake not, at Woodstock."

a most <span class="smcap">notable library</span>, learning wonderfully be advanced,
the passing excellent works of our forefathers from rot and
worms preserved, and also hereafter continually the whole
realm may (through her grace's goodness) use and enjoy the
incomparable treasure so preserved: where now, no one
student, no, nor any one college, hath half a dozen of those
excellent jewels, but the whole stock and store thereof
drawing nigh to utter destruction, and extinguishing, while
here and there by private men's negligence (and sometimes
malice) many a famous and excellent author's book is rent,
burnt, or suffered to rot and decay. By your said
suppliant's device your Grace's said library might, in very
few years, most plentifully be furnisht, and that without
any one penny charge unto your Majesty, or doing injury to
any creature." In another supplicatory article, dated xv.
Jan. 1556, Dee advises copies of the monuments to be taken,
and the original, after the copy is taken, to be restored to
the owner. That there should be "allowance of all necessary
charges, as well toward the riding and journeying for the
recovery of the said worthy monuments, as also for the
copying out of the same, and framing of necessary stalls,
desks, and presses."&mdash;He concludes with proposing to make
copies of all the principal works in MS. "in the <span class="smcap">notablest</span>
libraries beyond the sea"&mdash;"and as concerning all other
excellent authors printed, that they likewise shall be
gotten in wonderful abundance, their carriage only to be
chargeable." He supposes that three months' trial would shew
the excellence of his plan; which he advises to be instantly
put into practice "for fear of the spreading of it abroad
might cause many to hide and convey away their good and
ancient writers&mdash;which, nevertheless, were ungodly done, and
a certain token that such are not sincere lovers of good
learning." [In other words, not sound bibliomaniacs.] See
the Appendix to Hearne's edition of <i>Joh. Confrat. Monach.

from the bigotted sovereign to whom it was addressed. A
project for a similar establishment in Queen Elizabeth's
reign, when a Society of Antiquaries was first established
in this kingdom, may be seen in Hearne's <i>Collection of
Curious Discourses of Antiquaries</i>; vol. ii., p. 324,&mdash;when
this library was "to be entitled <span class="smcap">the library of Queen

<p><a name="Footnote_329_335" id="Footnote_329_335"></a><a href="#FNanchor_329_335">[329]</a> <span class="smcap">Roger Ascham</span> is now, I should hope, pretty
firmly established among us as one of the very best
classical writers in our language. Nearly three centuries
are surely sufficient to consecrate his literary celebrity.
He is an author of a peculiar and truly original cast. There
is hardly a dull page or a dull passage in his lucubrations.
He may be thought, however, to have dealt rather harshly
with our old romance writers; nor do I imagine that the
original edition of his <i>Schoolmaster</i> (1571), would be
placed by a <i>Morte d'Arthur</i> collector alongside of his thin
black-letter quarto romances. Ascham's invectives against
the Italian school, and his hard-hearted strictures upon the
innocent ebullitions of Petrarch and Boccaccio, have been
noticed, with due judgment and spirit, by Mr. Burnet, in his
pleasing analysis of our philosopher's works. See <i>Specimens
of English Prose Writers</i>; vol. ii., p. 84. Our tutor's
notions of academical education, and his courteous treatment
of his royal and noble scholars, will be discoursed of anon;
meantime, while we cursorily, but strongly, applaud Dr.
Johnson's almost unqualified commendation of this able
writer; and while the reader may be slightly informed of the
elegance and interest of his epistles; let the bibliomaniac
hasten to secure Bennet's edition of Ascham's works (which
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: incorporates">incorparates</span> the notes of
Upton upon the Schoolmaster, with the Life of, and remarks
upon Ascham, by Dr. Johnson), published in a handsome quarto
volume [1761]. This edition, though rather common and cheap,
should be carefully reprinted in an octavo volume; to
harmonize with the greater number of our best writers
published in the same form. But it is time to mention
something of the author connected with the subject of this
work. What relates to the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>, I here select from
similar specimens in his English letters, written when he
was abroad: "Oct. 4. at afternoon I went about the town [of
Bruxelles]. I went to the frier Carmelites house, and heard
their even song: after, I desired to see the <span class="smcap">library</span>. A
frier was sent to me, and led me into it. There was not one
good book but <i>Lyra</i>. The friar was learned, spoke Latin
readily, entered into Greek, having a very good wit, and a
greater desire to learning. He was gentle and honest," &amp;c.
pp. 370-1. "Oct. 20. to Spira: a good city. Here I first saw
<i>Sturmius de Periodis</i>. I also found here <i>Ajax</i>, <i>Electra</i>,
and <i>Antigone</i> of <i>Sophocles</i>, excellently, by my good
judgment, translated into verse, and fair printed this
summer by Gryphius. Your stationers do ill, that at least do
not provide you the register of all books, especially of old
authors," &amp;c., p. 372. Again: "Hieronimus Wolfius, that
translated Demosthenes and Isocrates, is in this town. I am
well acquainted with him, and have brought him twice to my
lord's to dinner. He looks very simple. He telleth me that
one Borrheus, that hath written well upon Aristot. priorum,
&amp;c., even now is printing goodly commentaries upon
Aristotle's Rhetoric. But Sturmius will obscure them all."
p. 381. These extracts are taken from Bennet's edition. Who
shall hence doubt of the propriety of classing Ascham among
the most renowned bibliomaniacs of the age?</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">From the tutor of Elizabeth let us go to her prime minister,

entertain a doubt? Who that has seen how frequently his name is
affixed to Dedications, can disbelieve that Cecil was a <span class="smcap">lover of
books</span>? Indeed I question whether it is inserted more frequently in a
diplomatic document or printed volume. To possess all the presentation

the distorted and shameful delineation of his character,

ante. He will, on the contrary, look upon Cecil as a lover
of books, not for the sake of the numerous panegyrical
dedications to himself, which he must have so satisfactorily
perused, but for the sake of the good to be derived from
useful and ingenious works. With one hand, this great man
may be said to have wielded the courageous spirit, and
political virtue, of his country&mdash;and with the other, to

Without reading the interesting and well-written life of
Cecil, in Mr. Macdiarmid's <i>Lives of British Statesmen</i> (a
work which cannot be too often recommended, or too highly
praised), there is evidence sufficient of this statesman's
bibliomaniacal passion and taste, in the <span class="smcap">fine old library</span>
which is yet preserved at Burleigh in its legitimate
form&mdash;and which, to the collector of such precious volumes,
must have presented a treat as exquisite as are the fresh
blown roses of June to him who regales himself in the
flowery fragrance of his garden&mdash;the production of his own
manual labour! Indeed Strypes tells us that Cecil's "library
was a very choice one:" his care being "in the preservation,
rather than in the private possession of (literary)
antiquities." Among other curiosities in it, there was a
grand, and a sort of presentation, copy of Archbishop
Parker's Latin work of the <i>Antiquity of the British
Church</i>; "bound costly, and laid in colours the arms of the
Church of Canterbury, empaled with the Archbishop's own
paternal coat." Read Strype's tempting description; <i>Life of
Parker</i>; pp. 415, 537. Well might Grafton thus address Cecil
at the close of his epistolary dedication of his
<i>Chronicles</i>: "and now having ended this work, and seeking
to whom I might, for testification of my special good-will,
present it, or for patronage and defence dedicate it, and
principally, for all judgment and correction to submit
it&mdash;among many, I have chosen your <span class="smcap">Mastership</span>, moved thereto
by experience of your courteous judgment towards those that
travail to any honest purpose, rather helping and comforting
their weakness, than condemning their simple, but yet well
meaning, endeavours. By which, your accustomed good
acceptation of others, I am the rather boldened to beseech
your Mastership to receive this my work and me, in such
manner as you do those in whom (howsoever there be want of
power) there wanteth no point of goodwill and serviceable
affection." Edit. 1809, 4to. If a chronicler could talk
thus, a poet (who, notwithstanding the title of his poem,
does not, I fear, rank among Pope's bards, that "sail aloft
among <i>the Swans of Thames</i>,") may be permitted thus to
introduce Cecil's name and mansion:</p>

<p class="bp">For my part, Lorenzo, I know of no character, either of this or of any
subsequent period, which is more entitled to the esteem and veneration
of Englishmen. Pious, diffident, frank, charitable, learned, and
munificent, Parker was the great episcopal star of his age, which
shone with undiminished lustre to the last moment of its appearance.
In that warm and irritable period, when the Protestant religion was
assailed in proportion to its excellence, and when writers mistook
abuse for argument, it is delightful to think upon the mild and
temperate course which this discreet metropolitan pursued! Even with
such arrant bibliomaniacs as yourselves, Parker's reputation must
stand as high as that attached to any name, when I inform you that of
his celebrated work upon the "<i>Antiquity of the British Church</i>"<a name="FNanchor_331_337" id="FNanchor_331_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_337" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
are only twenty copies supposed to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span> printed. He had a
private press, which was worked with types cast at his own expense;
and a more determined book-fancier, and treasurer of ancient lore, did
not at that time exist in Great Britain.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_331_337" id="Footnote_331_337"></a><a href="#FNanchor_331_337">[331]</a> This is not the place to enter minutely into
a bibliographical account of the above celebrated work; such
account being with more propriety reserved for the history
of our <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>. Yet a word or two may be
here said upon it, in order that the bibliomaniac may not be
wholly disappointed; and especially as Ames and Herbert have
been squeamishly reserved in their
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: communications">comunications</span> respecting the same.
The above volume is, without doubt, one of the scarcest
books in existence. It has been intimated by Dr. Drake, in
the preface of his magnificent reprint of it, 1729, fol.,
that only 20 copies were struck off: but, according to
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Strype">Stype</span>, Parker tells Cecil, in an
emblazoned copy presented to him by the latter, that he had
not given the book to <i>four</i> men in the whole realm: and
peradventure, added he, "it shall never come to sight
abroad, though some men, smelling of the printing of it,
were very desirous cravers of the same." <i>Life of Parker</i>,
p. 415. This certainly does not prove any thing respecting
the number of copies printed; but it is probable that Dr.
Drake's supposition is not far short of the truth. One thing
is remarkable: of all the copies known, no two are found to
accord with each other. The archbishop seems to have altered
and corrected the sheets as they each came from the press.
The omission of the Archbishop's own life in this volume, as
it contained the biography of 69 archbishops, exclusively of
himself, was endeavoured to be supplied by the publication
of a sharp satirical tract, entitled, "<i>The life off the 70
Archbishop of Canterbury, presenttye sittinge Englished, and
to be added to the 69 lately sett forth in Latin</i>," &amp;c.,
12mo., 1574. After this title page there is another.
"<i>Histriola, a little storye of the acts and life of Mathew,
now Archbishoppe of Canterb.</i>" This latter comprehends 17
leaves, and was written either by the archbishop himself, or
by his Chaplain Joscelyne; but whether it be at all like a
distinct printed folio tract, of twelve leaves and a half,
which was kept carefully undispersed in the archbishop's own
possession, 'till his death&mdash;being also a biography of
Parker&mdash;I am not able to ascertain. The following extracts
from it (as it is a scarce little volume) may be acceptable,
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Archbishop Parker's early Studies and popular Preaching.</i></p>

<p>"But now, he being very well and perfectly instructed in the
liberal sciences, he applied all his mind to the study of
divinity, and to the reading of the volumes of the
ecclesiastical fathers; and that so earnestly that, in short
space of time, he bestowed his labour not unprofitably in
this behalf; for, after the space of four or five years, he,
issuing from his secret and solitary study into open
practice in the commonwealth, preached every where unto the
people with great commendation; and that in the most famous
cities and places of this realm, by the authority of King
Henry VIII., by whose letters patent this was granted unto
him, together with the license of the Archbishop of
Canterbury. In execution of this function of preaching, he
gained this commodity; that the fame of him came unto the
ears of King Henry," &amp;c. Sign. A. iij. recto.
</p>

<p class="center"><i>His attention to Literature and Printing, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;he was very careful, and not without some charges, to
seek the monuments of former times; to know the religion of
the ancient fathers, and those especially which were of the
English church. Therefore in seeking up the Chronicles of
the Britons and English Saxons, which lay hidden every where
contemned and buried in forgetfulness, and through the
ignorance of the languages not well understanded, his own
especially, and his mens, diligence wanted not. And to the
end that these antiquities might last long, and be carefully
kept, he caused them, being brought into one place, <i>to be
well bound and trimly covered</i>. And yet, not so contented,
he endeavoured to set out in print certain of those ancient
monuments, whereof he knew very few examples to be extant;
and which he thought would be most profitable for the
posterity, to instruct them in the faith and religion of the
elders. [Orig. 'to instructe them in the faythe and religion
off the elders.] Hereupon, he caused the perpetual histories
of the English affairs, by <i>Mathæus Parisiensis</i>, once a
monk of Saint Alban's, and <i>Mathæus Florilegus</i>, a monk of
Saint Peter in Westminster, written in Latin, to be printed;
after he had diligently conferred them with the examples
which he could get in any place; to the end that, as
sincerely as might be, as the authors first left them, he
might deliver them into other men's hands. Lastly, that he
might not be unmindful of those monuments which, both in
antiquity, worthiness, and authority, excelled all other, or
rather wherewith none are to be compared (I mean the Holy
Scriptures) here he thought to do great good if, by his
number, he increased the <i>Holy Bibles</i>, which shortly would
be wanting to many churches, if this discommodity were not
provided for in time. Therefore it seemed good unto him,
first, with his learned servants, to examine thoroughly the
English translation; wherein he partly used the help of his
brethren bishops, and other doctors; with whom he dealt so
diligently in this matter that they disdained not to be
partners and fellows with him of his labor. And now all
their work is set out in very fair forms and letters of
print," &amp;c. Sign. C. rect. &amp; rev.
</p>

<p class="center"><i>His work De Antiquitate Ecclesiæ Britannicæ.</i></p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;Much more praiseworthy is she (the 'Assyrian Queen of
Babylon,') than he, whosoever it was, that of late hath set
forth, to the hurt of christian men, certain rhapsodies and
shreds of the old forworn stories, almost forgotten&mdash;had he
not (Parker) now lately awakened them out of a dead sleep,
and newly sewed them together in one book printed; whose
glorious life promiseth not mountains of gold, as that silly
heathen woman's (the aforesaid Queen) tomb, but beareth
Christ in the brow, and is honested with this title in the
front, 'De Antiquitate,' &amp;c." Sign. C. iiij. rev. The
satirical part, beginning with "To the Christian Reader,"
follows the biography from which these extracts have been
taken. It remains to observe, that our <span class="smcap">Archbishop</span> was a
bibliomaniac of the very first order; and smitten with every
thing attached to a <span class="smcap">Book</span>, to a degree beyond any thing
exhibited by his contemporaries. Parker did not scruple to
tell Cecil that he kept in his house "drawers of pictures,
wood-cutters, painters, limners, writers, and
book-binders,"&mdash;"one of these was <span class="smcap">Lylye</span>, an excellent
writer, that could counterfeit any antique writing. Him the
archbishop customarily used to make old books
compleat,"&mdash;&amp;c. <i>Strype's Life of Parker</i>; pp. 415, 529.
Such was his ardour for book-collecting that he had agents
in almost all places, abroad and at home, for the purpose of
securing everything that was curious, precious, and rare:
and one of these, of the name of Batman (I suppose the
commentator upon Bartholomæus) "in the space of no more than
four years, procured for our archbishop to the number of
6700 books." <i>Id.</i> p. 528. The riches of his book bequests
to Cambridge are sufficiently described by Strype; pp. 501,
518, 519, 529, &amp;c. The domestic habits and personal
appearance of <span class="smcap">Parker</span> are described by his biographer (p.
504) as being simple and grave. Notwithstanding his aversion
to wearing silk, to plays and jests, and hawks and hounds
(even when he was a young man), I take it for granted he
could have no inward dislike to the beautiful and
appropriate ceremony which marked his consecration, and
which is thus narrated by the lively pen of Fuller: "The
east part of the chapel of Lambeth was hung with tapestry,
the floor spread with red cloth, chairs and cushions are
conveniently placed for the purpose: morning prayers being
solemnly read by Andrew Peerson, the archbishop's chaplain,
Bishop Scory went up into the pulpit, and took for his text,
<i>The Elders which are among you I exhort, who also am an
elder; and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, &amp;c.</i>
Sermon ended, and the sacrament administered, they proceed
to the consecration. The <span class="smcap">Archbishop</span> had his rochet on, with
<span class="smcap">Hereford</span>; and the suffragan of Bedford, <span class="smcap">Chichester</span>, wore a
silk cope; and <span class="smcap">Coverdale</span> a plain cloth gown down to his
ancles. All things are done conformable to the book of
ordination: Litany sung; the Queen's patent for Parker's
consecration audibly read by Dr. Vale: He is presented: the
oath of supremacy tendered to him; taken by him; hands
reverently imposed on him; and all with prayers begun,
continued, concluded. In a word, though here was no
theatrical pomp to made it a popish pageant; though no
sandals, gloves, ring, staff, oil, pall, &amp;c., were used upon
him&mdash;yet there was ceremony enough to clothe his
consecration with decency, though not to clog it with
superstition." <i>Church History</i>, b. ix., p. 60. But the
virtues of the primate, however mild and unostentatious,
were looked upon with an envious eye by the maligant
observer of human nature; and the spontaneous homage which
he received from some of the first noblemen in the realm was
thus lampooned in the satirical composition just before
noticed:
</p>

<p class="center"><i>Homage and Tribute paid to Archbishop Parker.</i></p>

<p>"The next is, what great tributes every made bishop paid
him. How they entertained his whole household or court, for
the time, with sumptuous feasting. How dearly they redeemed
their own cloaths, and carpets, at his chaplain's hands.
What fees were bestowed on his crucifer, marshall, and other
servants. All which plentiful bounty, or rather, he might
have said, largess, is shrunk up, he saith, to a small sum
of ten pounds, somewhat beside, but very small, bestowed, he
might have said cast away, upon the archbishop's family,
&amp;c.&mdash;The same earl (of Gloucester) must be his steward and
chief cupbearer, the day of his inthronization: This is not
to be called gracious Lords, as the Lords of the earth, but
this is to be beyond all grace; and to be served of these
gracious Lords, and to be their Lord paramount. In this roll
of his noble tenants, the next are the Lord Strangways, the
Earl of Oxford, the Lord Dacy, all which (saith he) owe
service to that Archbishop. Then descendeth he to the gifts
that every his suffragan provincial bishop bestoweth on him,
in their life, and at their death: some their palfrey with
saddle and furniture; some their rings, and some their
seals. Among the rest, the Bishop of Rochester, who is there
called specially his chaplain, giveth him a brace of dogs.
These be trim things for prelates to give or receive;
especially of them to make such account as to print them
among such special prerogatives." Sign. D. iiij. v. Yet even
to this libel was affixed the following epitaph upon Parker;
which shews that truth "is great, and will prevail."</p>

dupe of the people and of the Court: and, although Meric Casaubon has

fear, will only live in the memory of bibliomaniacs!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_332_338" id="Footnote_332_338"></a><a href="#FNanchor_332_338">[332]</a> Those who are fond of copious biographical
details of astrologers and conjurers will read, with no
small pleasure and avidity, the long gossipping account of
<span class="smcap">Dee</span>, which Hearne has subjoined to his edition of <i>John
Confrat. Monach. de rebus gestis Glaston.</i>, vol. ii.; where
twelve chapters are devoted to the subject of our
philosopher's travels and hardships. Meric Casaubon&mdash;who put
forth a pompous folio volume of "<i>A true and faithful
relation of what passed for many yeers between Dr. John Dee
and some spirits</i>:" 1659&mdash;gravely assures us, in an
elaborate, learned, and rather amusing preface, that the
volume contains what "he thinks is not to be paralleled in
that kind by any book that hath been set out in any age to
read:" sign A. This is true enough; for such a farago of
incongruous, risible, and horrible events, are no where else
recorded. "None but itself can be its parallel." Casaubon
wrote a professed dissertation (1652, 8vo.) upon witches,
and nothing seemed to be too unpalatable for his credulity
to swallow. A compressed and rather interesting account of
Dee, who was really the weakest as well as the ablest
scholar and philosopher of his day, will be found in
Ashmole's <i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>, p. 480. From the substance of
these authorities, the reader is presented with the
following sketch. The first chapter in Hearne's publication,
which treats of the "entrance and ground plot of his first
studies," informs us that he had received his Latin
education in London and Chelmsford: that he was born in
July, 1527, and at 15 years of age was entered at the
University of Cambridge, 1542. In the three following years,
"so vehemently was he bent to study that, for those years,
he did inviolably keep this order; only to sleep 4 hours
every night; to allow to meat and drink (and some refreshing
after) 2 hours every day; and of the other 18 hours, all
(excepting the time of going to, and being at, divine
service) was spent in his studies and learning." In May,
1547, after having taken his Bachelor's decree, he went
abroad. "And after some months spent about the Low
Countries, he returned home, and brought with him the first
astronomer's staff in brass, that was made of Gemma Frisius
devising; the two great globes of Gerardus Mercator's
making, and the astronomer's ring of brass, as Gemma Frisius
had newly framed it." Dee's head now began to run wild upon
astronomy, or rather astrology; and the tremendous
assistance of the "occult art" was called in to give effect
to the lectures which he read upon it at home and abroad.
"He did set forth (and it was seen of the University) a
Greek comedy of Aristophanes, named, in Greek,
<span lang="el" title="Greek: eirênê">&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8053;&#957;&#951;</span>, in Latin, <i>Pax</i>; with the performance of the
<i>Scarabæus</i> his flying up to Jupiter's palace, with a man
and his basket of victuals on his back: whereat was great
wondering and many vain reports spread abroad of the means
how that was effected. In that college (Trinity, for he had
now left St. John's), by his advice and endeavours, was
their Christmas magistrate first named and confirmed an
<span class="smcap">emperor</span>." The first emperor of this sort, (whose <i>name</i>, it
must be confessed, is rather unpopular in a University) he
takes care to inform us, "was one Mr. Thomas <i>Dun</i>, a very
goodly man of person, stature, and complexion, and well
learned also." Dee afterwards ranks these things among "his
boyish attempts and exploits scholastical." In 1548 he was
made Master of Arts, and in the same year "went over beyond
the seas again, and never after that was any more student in
Cambridge." Abroad, almost every emperor and nobleman of
distinction, according to his own account, came to see and
hear him. "For recreation, he looked into the method of the
civil law, and profitted therein so much that, in
<i>Antinomiis</i>, imagined to be in the law, he had good hap to
find out (well allowed of) their agreements; and also to
enter into a plain and due understanding of diverse civil
laws, accounted very intricate and dark." At Paris, when he
gave lectures upon Euclid's elements, "a thing never done
publicly in any university in Christendom, his auditory in
Rhemes college was so great, and the most part elder than
himself, that the mathematical schools could not hold them;
for many were fain, without the schools, at the windows, to
be <i>Auditores et Spectatores</i>, as they could best help
themselves thereto. And by the first four principal
definitions representing to their eyes (which by imagination
only are exactly to be conceived) a greater wonder arose
among the beholders than of his <i>Aristophanes Scarabæus</i>
mounting up to the top of Trinity Hall, <i>ut supra</i>."
Notwithstanding the tempting offers to cause him to be
domiciled in France and Germany, our astrologer, like a true
patriot, declined them all. The French king offered an
annual stipend of 200 French crowns; a Monsieur Babeu,
Monsieur de Rohan, and Monsieur de Monluc, offered still
greater sums, but were all refused. In Germany he was
tempted with the yearly salary of 3000 dollars; "and lastly,
by a messenger from the Russie or Muscovite Emperor,
purposely sent with a very rich present unto him at Trebona
castle, and with provision for the whole journey (being
above 1200 miles from the castle where he lay) of his coming
to his court at Moscow, with his wife, children, and whole
family, there to enjoy at his imperial hands 2000<span class="super">lib.</span>
sterling yearly stipend; and of his Protector yearly a
thousand rubles; with his diet also to be allowed him free
out of the emperor's own kitchen: and to be in dignity with
authority amongst the highest sort of the nobility there,
and of his Privy Counsellors."&mdash;But all this was heroically
declined by our patriotic philosopher. Lord Pembroke and
Lord Leicester introduced Dee to the notice of Q. Elizabeth,
before her coronation. At which time her Majesty used these
words&mdash;"<i>Where my brother hath given him a crown, I will
give him a noble!</i>" Before the accession of Elizabeth, he
was imprisoned on being accused of destroying Queen Mary by
enchantment. "The Queen Elizabeth herself became a prisoner
in the same place (Hampton Court) shortly afterwards; and
Dee had for bedfellow one Barthelet Green, who was
afterwards burnt." Dee himself was examined by Bishop
Bonner. On the deanery of Gloucester becoming void in 1564,
Dee was nominated to fill it: but the same deanery was
afterwards bestowed on Mr. Man, who was sent into Spain in
her Majesty's service. "And now this Lent, 1594, when it
became void again (says Dee), I made a motion for it, but I
came too late; for one that might spend 400 or 500 lib. a
year already, had more need of it than I belike; or else
this former gift was but words only to me, and the fruit
ever due to others, that can espy and catch better than I
for these 35 years could do." Mistris Blanche à Parry came
to his house with an offer from the Queen of "any
ecclesiastical dignity within her kingdom, being then, or
shortly becoming, void and vacant"&mdash;but "Dee's most humble
and thankful answer to her Majesty, by the same messenger,
was that <i>cura animarum annexa</i> did terrifie him to deal
with." He was next promised to "have of her Majesty's gift
other ecclesiastical livings and revenues (without care of
souls annexed) as in her Majesty's books were rated at two
hundred pounds yearly revenue; of which her Majesty's gift
he never as yet had any one penny." In Oct. 1578, he had a
consultation with Mr. Doctor Bayly, her Majesty's physician,
"about her Majestie's grievous pangs and pains by reason of
the toothake and rheum," &amp;c. "He set down in writing, with
hydrographical and geographical description, what he then
had to say or shew, as concerning her Majesty's title royal
to any foreign countries. Whereof two parchment great rolls
full written, of about <span class="smcap">xii white vellum skins</span>, were good
witnesses upon the table before the commissioners." Dee had
refused an hundred pounds for these calligraphical labours.
A list of his printed and unprinted works: the former 8
(ending with the year 1573), the latter 36 (ending with the
year 1592), in number. Anno 1563, Julii ultimo, the Earl of
Leicester and Lord Laskey invited themselves to dine with
Dee in a day or two; but our astrologer "confessed sincerely
that he was not able to prepare them a convenient dinner,
unless he should presently sell some of his plate or some of
his pewter for it. Whereupon," continues Dee, "her Majesty
sent unto me very royally within one hour after forty angels
of gold, from Sion; whither her Majesty was now come by
water from Greenwich." A little before Christmas, 1599, Dee
mentions a promise of another royal donation of
100<i>l.</i>&mdash;"which intent and promise, some once or twice
after, as he came in her Majesty's sight, she repeated unto
him; and thereupon sent unto him <i>fifty pounds</i> to keep his
Christmas with that year&mdash;but what, says he, is become of
the other fifty, truly I cannot tell! If her Majesty can, it
is sufficient; '<i>Satis, citò, modò, satis bene</i>, must I
say.'" In 1591, his patroness, the Countess of Warwick, made
a powerful diversion at Court to secure for him the
mastership of St. Cross, then filled by Dr. Bennet, who was
to be made a bishop.&mdash;The queen qualified her promise of
Dee's having it with a nota bene, <i>if he should be fit for
it</i>. In 1592, the Archbishop of Canterbury openly "affirmed
that the mastership of St. Crosse was a living most fit for
him; and the Lord Treasurer, at Hampton Court, lately to
himself declared, and with his hand very earnestly smitten
on his breast used these very words to him&mdash;'<i>By my faith</i>,
if her Majestie be moved in it by any other for you, I will
do what I can with her Majestie to pleasure you therein, Mr.
Dee.'" But it is time to gratify the <span class="smcap">Bibliomaniac</span> with
something more to his palate. Here followeth, therefore, as
drawn up by our philosopher himself, an account of
</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dee's Library:</span></p>

<p>"4000 <i>Volumes</i>&mdash;printed and unprinted&mdash;bound and
unbound&mdash;valued at 2000 <i>lib.</i>
</p><p>
1 Greek, 2 French, and 1 High Dutch, volumes of MSS., alone
worth 533 <i>lib.</i> 40 years in getting these books together."
</p><p>
Appertaining thereto,
</p><p>
<i>Sundry rare and exquisitely made Mathematical Instruments.</i>
</p><p>
<i>A radius Astronomicus</i>, ten feet long.
</p><p>
<i>A Magnet Stone, or Loadstone</i>; of great virtue&mdash;"which was
sold out of the library for <i>v shill.</i> and for it afterwards
(yea piece-meal divided) was more than xx <i>lib.</i> given in
money and value."
</p><p>
"<i>A great case or frame of boxes</i>, wherein some hundreds of
very rare evidences of divers Irelandish territories,
provinces, and lands, were laid up. Which territories,
provinces, and lands were therein notified to have been in
the hands of some of the ancient Irish princes. Then, their
submissions and tributes agreed upon, with seals appendant
to the little writings thereof in parchment: and after by
some of those evidences did it appear how some of those
lands came to the Lascies, the Mortuomars, the Burghs, the
Clares," &amp;c.
</p><p>
"<i>A box of Evidences</i> antient of some Welch princes and
noblemen&mdash;the like of Norman donation&mdash;their peculiar titles
noted on the forepart with chalk only, which on the poor
boxes remaineth." This box, with another, containing similar
deeds, were embezzled.
</p><p>
"One great bladder with about 4 pound weight, of a very
sweetish thing, like a brownish gum in it, artificially
prepared by thirty times purifying of it, hath more than I
could well afford him for 100 crownes; as may be proved by
witnesses yet living."
</p><p>
To these he adds his <i>three Laboratories</i>, "serving for
Pyrotechnia"&mdash;which he got together after 20 years' labour.
"All which furniture and provision, and many things already
prepared, is unduly made away from me by sundry meanes, and
a few spoiled or broken vessels remain, hardly worth 40
shillings." But one more feature in poor Dee's
character&mdash;and that is his unparalleled serenity and good
nature under the most griping misfortunes&mdash;remains to be
described: and then we may take farewell of him, with aching
hearts. In the 10th chapter, speaking of the wretched
poverty of himself and family&mdash;("having not one penny of
certain fee, revenue, stipend, or pension, either left him
or restored unto him,")&mdash;Dee says that "he has been
constrained now and then to send parcels of his little
furniture of plate to pawn upon usury; and that he did so
oft, till no more could be sent. After the same manner went
his wives' jewels of gold, rings, bracelets, chains, and
other their rarities, under the thraldom of the usurer's
gripes: 'till <i>non plus</i> was written upon the boxes at
home." In the 11th chapter, he anticipates the dreadful lot
of being brought "to the stepping out of doors (his house
being sold). He, and his, with bottles and wallets
furnished, to become wanderers as homish vagabonds; or, as
banished men, to forsake the kingdom!" Again: "with bloody
tears of heart, he, and his wife, their seven children, and
their servant (seventeen of them in all), did that day make
their petition unto their honours," &amp;c. Can human misery be
sharper than this&mdash;and to be the lot of a philosopher and
bibliomaniac?! But "<span class="smcap">veniet felicius ævum</span>."</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>Of a wholly different cast of character and of reading was the
renowned <span class="smcap">Captain Cox</span> of Coventry. How many of Dee's magical books he
had exchanged for the pleasanter magic of <i>Old Ballads</i> and
<i>Romances</i>, I will not take upon me to say; but that this said
bibliomaniacal Captain had a library, which, even from Master
Laneham's imperfect description of it,<a name="FNanchor_333_339" id="FNanchor_333_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_339" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span> have preferred
to the four thousand volumes of Dr. John Dee, is most
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: unquestionable">nuquestionable</span>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_333_339" id="Footnote_333_339"></a><a href="#FNanchor_333_339">[333]</a> Let us be introduced to the sprightly figure
and expression of character of this renowned Coventry
captain, before we speak particularly of his library.
"<span class="smcap">Captain Cox</span> (says the above-mentioned Master Laneham) came
marching on valiantly before, clean trust and gartered above
the knee, all fresh in a velvet cap (Master Golding a lent
it him), flourishing with his <i>ton</i> sword; and another fence
master with him:" p. 39. A little before, he is thus
described as connected with his library: "And first, Captain
Cox; an odd man, I promise you: by profession a mason, and
that right skilful: very cunning in fens (fencing); and
hardy as Gawin; for his <i>ton</i> sword hangs at his table's
end. Great oversight hath he in matters of story: for as for
<i>King Arthur's</i> Book, <i>Huon of Bourdeaux</i>, the <i>Four Sons of
Aymon</i>, <i>Bevys of Hampton</i>, <i>The Squyre of Low Degree</i>, <i>The
Knight of Curtsy</i>, and the <i>Lady Fagnel</i>, <i>Frederick of
Gene</i>, <i>Syr Eglamour</i>, <i>Syr Tryamour</i>, <i>Syr Lamurell</i>, <i>Syr
Isenbras</i>, <i>Syr Gawyn</i>, <i>Olyver of the Castl</i>, <i>Lucres and
Eurialus</i>, <i>Virgil's Life</i>, <i>the Castl of Ladies</i>, <i>the
Widow Edyth</i>, <i>the King and the Tanner</i>, <i>Frier Rous</i>,
<i>Howleglas</i>, <i>Gargantua</i>, <i>Robin Hood</i>, <i>Adam Bel</i>, <i>Clim on
the Clough</i>, and <i>William of Cloudsley</i>, <i>the Churl and the
Burd</i>, <i>the Seaven Wise Masters</i>, <i>the Wife lapt in a
Morel's skin</i>, <i>the Sakful of Nuez</i>, <i>the Sergeaunt that
became a Fryar</i>, <i>Skogan</i>, <i>Collyn Cloout</i>, <i>the Fryar and
the Boy</i>, <i>Elynor Rumming</i>, and <i>the Nutbrooun Maid</i>, with
many more than I rehearse here. I believe he has them all at
his finger's ends," p. 36. The preceding is a list of the
worthy Captain's <span class="smcap">Romances</span>; some of which, at least in their
original shape, were unknown to Ritson: what would be the
amount of their present produce under the hammer of those
renowned black-letter-book auctioneers in King-street,
Covent Garden&mdash;? Speak we, in the next place, of the said
military bibliomaniac's collection of books in "<span class="smcap">philosophy
moral</span> and <span class="smcap">natural</span>." "Beside <i>Poetry</i> and <i>Astronomy</i>, and
other hid sciences, as I may guess by the omberty of his
books: whereof part are, as I remember, <i>The Shepherd's
Kalendar</i>, <i>the Ship of Fools</i>, <i>Daniel's Dreams</i>, <i>the Book
of Fortune</i>, <i>Stans</i>, <i>puer ad mensam</i>, <i>the bye way to the
Spitl-house</i>, <i>Julian of Brainford's Testament</i>, <i>the Castle
of Love</i>, <i>the Booget of Demaunds</i>, <i>the Hundred Mery
Talez</i>, <i>the Book of Riddels</i>, <i>the Seaven Sorows of Wemen</i>,
<i>the Proud Wives' Pater-Noster</i>, <i>the Chapman of a
Penniworth of Wit</i>: Beside his <span class="smcap">auncient plays</span>; <i>Youth and
Charitee</i>, <i>Hikskorner</i>, <i>Nugize</i>, <i>Impacient Poverty</i>, and
herewith Doctor <i>Boord's Breviary of Health</i>. What should I
rehearse here, what a bunch of <span class="smcap">ballads and songs</span>, all
ancient?!&mdash;Here they come, gentle reader; lift up thine eyen
and marvel while thou dost peruse the same: <i>Broom Broom on
Hill</i>, <i>So wo iz me begon</i>, <i>trolly lo Over a Whinny Meg</i>,
<i>Hey ding a ding</i>, <i>Bony lass upon a green</i>, <i>My bony on
gave me a bek</i>, <i>By a bank az I lay</i>; and <i>two more</i> he hath
fair wrapt up in parchment, and bound with a whipcord!" It
is no wonder that Ritson, in the historical essay prefixed
to his collection of <i>Scottish Songs</i>, should speak of some
of these ballads with a zest as if he would have sacrificed
half his library to untie the said "whipcord" packet. And
equally joyous, I ween, would my friend Mr. R.H. Evans, of
Pall-Mall, have been&mdash;during his editorial labours in
publishing a new edition of his father's collection of
Ballads&mdash;(an edition, by the bye, which gives us more of the
genuine spirit of the <span class="smcap">Coxean collection</span> than any with which
I am acquainted)&mdash;equally joyous would Mr. Evans have been
to have had the inspection of some of these 'bonny' songs.
The late Duke of Roxburgh, of never-dying bibliomaniacal
celebrity, would have parted with half the insignia of his
order of the Garter to have obtained <i>clean original copies</i>
of these fascinating effusions! But let us return, and take
farewell of Captain Cox, by noticing only the remaining
department of his library, as described by Laneham. "As for
<span class="smcap">Almanacs</span> of antiquity (a point for Ephemerides) I ween he
can shew from <i>Jasper Laet of Antwerp</i>, unto <i>Nostradam of
Frauns</i>, and thence unto our <i>John Securiz of Salisbury</i>. To
stay ye no longer herein (concludes Laneham) I dare say he
hath as fair a library of these sciences, and as many goodly
monuments both in prose and poetry, and at afternoon can
talk as much without book, as any innholder betwixt
Brentford and Bagshot, what degree soever he be." <i>A Letter
wherein part of the Entertainment untoo the Queenz Majesty
at Killingwoorth Castl in Warwick-Sheer, in this Soomerz
Progrest, 1575, is signefied</i>: Warwick, 1784, 8vo. <span class="smcap">O rare
Captain Cox</span>!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">We now approach two characters of a more dignified cast; and who, in
every respect, must be denominated the greatest bibliomaniacs of the
age: I mean <span class="smcap">Sir Robert Cotton</span> and <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Bodley</span>. We will touch
upon them separately.</p>

<p class="bp">The numerous relics which are yet preserved of the <i>Cottonian
Collection</i>, may serve to convey a pretty strong idea of its splendour
and perfection in its original shape. Cotton had all the sagacity and
judgment of Lord Coke, with a more beautifully polished mind, and a
more benevolent heart. As to books, and book men, he was the
Mecænas<a name="FNanchor_334_340" id="FNanchor_334_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_340" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> of his day. His thirst for knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span> could never be
satiated; and the cultivation of the mind upon the foundation of a
good heart, he considered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span> be the highest distinction, and the most
permanent delight, of human beings. Wealth, pomp, parade, and titles,
were dissipated, in the pure atmosphere of his mind before the
invigorating sun of science and learning. He knew that the tomb which
recorded the <i>worth</i> of the deceased had more honest tears shed upon
it than the pompous mausoleum which spoke only of his pedigree and
possessions. Accordingly, although he had excellent blood flowing in
his veins, Cotton sought connection with the good rather than with the
great; and where he found a cultivated understanding, and an honest
heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span> there he carried with him his <i>Lares</i>, and made another's
abode his own.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_334_340" id="Footnote_334_340"></a><a href="#FNanchor_334_340">[334]</a> There are few eminent characters of whom so
many, and such ably-executed, memoirs are extant as of <span class="smcap">Sir
Robert Cotton, Knt.</span> In the present place we have nothing to
do with his academical studies, his philosophical, or
legislative, or diplomatic, labours: literature and <i>Book
Madness</i> are our only subjects of discussion. Yet those who
may wish for more general, and possibly more interesting,
details, may examine the authorities referred to by Mr.
Planta in his very excellent <i>Catalogue of the MSS. in the
Cottonian Library</i>, 1802, folio. Sir Robert Cotton was
educated at Trinity-College, Cambridge. The number of
curious volumes, whether in the roman, gothic, or italic
type, which he in all probability collected during his
residence at the university, has not yet been ascertained;
but we know that, when he made his antiquarian tour with the
famous Camden, ("par nobile fratrum!") in his 29th year,
Cotton must have greatly augmented his literary treasures,
and returned to the metropolis with a sharpened appetite, to
devour every thing in the shape of a book. Respected by
three sovereigns, Elizabeth, James, and Charles, and admired
by all the literati in Europe, Sir Robert saw himself in as
eminent a situation as wealth, talents, taste, and integrity
can place an individual. His collection of books increased
rapidly; but MS. records, deeds, and charters, were the
chief objects of his pursuit. His mansion was noble, his
library extensive, and his own manners such as conciliated
the esteem of almost every one who approached him. Dr. Smith
has well described our illustrious bibliomaniac, at this
golden period of his life: "Ad Cottoni ædes, tanquam ad
communem reconditioris doctrinæ apothecam, sive ad novam
Academiam, quotquot animo paulo erectiori musis et gratiis
litaverint, sese recepere, nullam a viro humanissimo
repulsam passuri: quippe idem literas bonas promovendi
studium erat omni auctoramento longe potentius. Nec ista
obvia morum facilitas, qua omnes bonos eruditionisque
candidatos complexus est, quicquam reverentiæ qua vicissim
ille colebatur, detraxerat: potius, omnium, quos familiari
sermone, repititisque colloquiis dignari placuit, in se
amores et admirationem hac insigni naturæ benignitate
excitavit." Vit. Rob. Cottoni, p. xxiv., prefixed to the
<i>Catalogus Librorum Manuscriptorum Bibl. Cott.</i>, 1696,
folio. Sir Robert was, however, doomed to have the evening
of his life clouded by one of those crooked and disastrous
events, of which it is now impossible to trace the correct
cause, or affix the degree of ignominy attached to it, on
the head of its proper author. Human nature has few blacker
instances of turpitude on record than that to which our
knight fell a victim. In the year 1615, some wretch
communicated to the Spanish ambassador "the valuable state
papers in his library, who caused them to be copied and
translated into the Spanish:" these papers were of too much
importance to be made public; and James the 1st had the
meanness to issue a commission "which excluded Sir Robert
from his own library." The storm quickly blew over, and the
sunshine of Cotton's integrity diffused around its wonted
brilliancy. But in the year 1629, another mischievous wretch
propagated a report that Sir Robert had been privy to a
treasonable publication: because, forsooth, the original
tract, from which this treasonable one had been taken, was,
in the year 1613, without the knowledge of the owner of the
library, introduced into the Cottonian collection. This
wretch, under the abused title of librarian, had, "for
pecuniary considerations," the baseness to suffer one or
more copies of the pamphlet of 1613
(<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: written">writtten</span> at Florence by Dudley, Duke of
Northumberland, under a less offensive title) to be taken,
and in consequence printed. Sir Robert was therefore again
singled out for royal vengeance: his library was put under
sequestration; and the owner forbidden to enter it. It was
in vain that his complete innocence was vindicated. To
deprive such a man as <span class="smcap">Cotton</span> of the ocular and manual
comforts of his library&mdash;to suppose that he could be happy
in the most splendid drawing room in Europe, without his
books&mdash;is to suppose what our experience of virtuous
bibliomaniacs will not permit us to accede to. In
consequence, Sir Robert declared to his friends, "that they
had broken his heart who had locked up his library from
him:" which declaration he solemnly repeated to the Privy
Council. In the year 1631, this great and good man closed
his eyes for ever upon mortal scenes; upon those whom he
gladdened by his benevolence, and improved by his wisdom.
Such was the man, of whom Gale has thus eloquently
spoken:&mdash;"quisquis bona fide Historiam nostram per omne ævum
explicare sataget, nullum laudatum Scriptorem à se
desiderari exoptarique posse, quem <span class="smcap">Cottonianus</span> ille
incomparabilis thesaurus promptissime non exhibebit: Ea est,
et semper fuit, nobilis Domus ergo literatos
indulgentia&mdash;Hujus fores (ut illæ Musaram, apud Pindarum)
omnibus patent. Testes apello Theologos, Antiquarios,
Jurisconsultos, Bibliopolas; qui quidem omnes, ex Cottoniana
Bibliotheca, tanquam ex perenni, sed et communi fonte, sine
impensis et molestiâ, abundè hauserunt." <i>Rer. Anglic.
Script. Vet.</i>, vol. i., præf., p. 3. The loss of such a
character&mdash;the deprivation of such a patron&mdash;made the whole
society of book-collectors tremble and turn pale. Men began
to look sharply into their libraries, and to cast a
distrustful eye upon those who came to consult and to copy:
for the spirit of <span class="smcap">Cotton</span>, like the ghost of Hamlet's father,
was seen to walk, before cock-crow, along the galleries and
balconies of great collections, and to bid the owners of
them "remember and beware"!&mdash;But to return. The library of
this distinguished bibliomaniac continued under
sequestration some time after his death, and was preserved
entire, with difficulty, during the shock of the civil wars.
In the year 1712, it was removed to Essex House, in
Essex-street, Strand, where it continued till the year 1730,
when it was conveyed back to Westminster, and deposited in
Little Dean's Yard. In October, 1731, broke out that
dreadful fire, which Hearne (<i>Benedict. Abbat.</i>, vol. i.,
præf. p. xvi.) so pathetically deplores; and in which the
nation so generally sympathized&mdash;as it destroyed and
mutilated many precious volumes of this collection. Out of
958 volumes, 97 were destroyed, and 105 damaged. In the year
1753 the library, to the honour of the age, and as the only
atonement which could be made to the injured name of Cotton,
as well as to the effectual <i>laying</i> of his perturbed
spirit&mdash;was purchased by parliament, and transported within
the quiet and congenial abode of the <span class="smcap">British Museum</span>: and
here may it rest, unabused, for revolving ages! The
collection now contains 26,000 articles. Consult Mr.
Planta's neatly written preface to the catalogue of the
same; vide p. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>, <a href="#Page_267">267</a>, ante. And thus take we leave of the
ever-memorable bibliomaniac, Sir <span class="smcap">Robert Cotton, Knt.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">Equally celebrated for literary zeal, and yet more for bibliomaniacal
enthusiasm, was the famous <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Bodley</span>; whose account of
himself, in <i>Prince's Worthies of Devon</i>, and particularly in one of
<i>Hearne's publications</i>,<a name="FNanchor_335_341" id="FNanchor_335_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_341" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> can never be read without transport by
an affec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>tionate son of our Oxford <i>Alma Mater</i>. View this illustrious
bibliomaniac, with his gentleman-like air, and expressive countenance,
superintending, with the zeal of a Custom-house officer, the shipping,
or rather <i>barging</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span> of his books for the grand library which is now
called by his <span class="smcap">own name</span>! Think upon his activity in writing to almost
every distinguished character of the realm:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span> soliciting, urging,
arguing, entreating for their support towards his magnificent
establishment; and, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span> superintending the erection of the
building, as well as examining the timbers, with the nicety of a
master-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>carpenter!&mdash;Think of this; and when you walk under the grave
and appropriately-ornamented roof, which tells you that you are within
the precincts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span> <span class="smcap">Bodleian Library</span>, pay obeisance to the portrait
of the founder, and hold converse with his gentle spirit that dwells
therein!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_335_341" id="Footnote_335_341"></a><a href="#FNanchor_335_341">[335]</a> There are few subjects&mdash;to the bibliomaniac
in general&mdash;and particularly to one, who, like the author of
this work, numbers himself among the dutiful sons of the
<span class="smcap">fair Oxonian mother</span>&mdash;that can afford a higher gratification
than the history of the <span class="smcap">Bodleian library</span>, which, like
Virgil's description of fame,</p>

<p class="center">"Soon grew from pigmy to gigantic size."</p>

<p>The reader is therefore here informed, as a necessary
preliminary piece of intelligence, that the present note
will be more monstrous than any preceding one of a similar
nature. Let him, however, take courage, and only venture to
dip his feet in the margin of the lake, and I make little
doubt but that he will joyfully plunge in, and swim across
it. Of the parentage, birth, and education of Bodley there
seems to be no necessity for entering into the detail. The
monument which he has erected to his memory is lofty enough
for every eye to behold; and thereupon may be read the
things most deserving of being known. How long the subject
of his beloved library had occupied his attention it is
perhaps of equal difficulty and unimportance to know; but
his determination to carry this noble plan into effect is
thus pleasingly communicated to us by his own pen: "when I
had, I say, in this manner, represented to my thoughts, my
peculiar estate, I resolved thereupon to possess my soul in
peace all the residue of my days; to take my full farewell
of state employments; to satisfy my mind with that
mediocrity of worldly living that I have of my own, and so
to retire me from the Court; which was the epilogue and end
of all my actions and endeavours, of any important note,
till I came to the age of fifty-three years."&mdash;"Examining
exactly, for the rest of my life, what course I might take;
and, having, as I thought, sought all the ways to the wood,
I concluded, at the last, to set up my staff <span class="smcap">at the library
door in Oxon</span>, being thoroughly persuaded, in my solitude and
surcease from the commonwealth affairs, I could not busy
myself to better purpose than by reducing that place (which
then in every part lay ruinated and waste) to the public use
of Students." Prince's <i>Worthies of Devon</i>, p. 95, edit.
1810. Such being the reflections and determination of Sir
Thomas Bodley, he thus ventured to lay open his mind to the
heads of the University of Oxford:

learning. I know my portion is too slender to perform, for
the present, any answerable act to my willing disposition:
but yet, to notify some part of my desire in that behalf, I
have resolved thus to deal. Where there hath been heretofore
a public library in Oxford, which, you know, is apparent by
the room itself remaining, and by your statute records, I
will take the charge and cost upon me to reduce it again to
his former use: and to make it fit and handsome, with seats,
and shelves, and desks, and all that may be needfull, to
stir up other men's benevolence, to help to furnish it with
books. And this I purpose to begin, as soon as timber can be
gotten, to the intent that you may reap some speedy profit
of my project. And where before, as I conceive, it was to be
reputed but a store of books of divers benefactors, because
it never had any lasting allowance, for augmentation of the
number, or supply of books decayed: whereby it came to pass
that, when those that were in being were either wasted or
embezelled, the whole foundation came to ruin:&mdash;to meet with
that inconvenience, I will so provide hereafter (if God do
not hinder my present design) as you shall be still assured
of a standing annual rent, to be disbursed every year in
buying of books, in officers' stipends, and other pertinent
occasions, with which provision, and some order for the
preservation of the place, and of the furniture of it, from
accustomed abuses, it may, perhaps, in time to come, prove a
notable treasure for the multitude of volumes; an excellent
benefit for the use and ease of students; and a singular
ornament in the University. I am, therefore, to intreat you,
because I will do nothing without their public approbation,
to deliver this, that I have signified, in that good sort,
that you think meet: and when you please to let me know
their acceptation of my offer, I will be ready to effect it
with all convenient expedition. But, for the better
effecting of it, I do desire to be informed whether the
University be sufficiently qualified, by licence of
Mortmain, or other assurance, to receive a farther grant of
any rent or annuity than they do presently enjoy. And, if
any instruments be extant of the ancient donations to their
former library, I would, with their good liking, see a
transcript of them: and likewise of such statutes as were
devised by the founders, or afterwards by others for the
usage of the books. Which is now as much as I can think on,
whereunto, at your good leisure, I would request your
friendly answer. And, if it lie in my ability to deserve
your pains in that behalf, although we be not yet
acquainted, you shall find me very forward. From London,
Feb. 23, 1597.

<p>In the Easter following, "Mr. Bodley came to Oxford to view
the place on which he intended his bounty, and making them a
model of the design with the help of Mr. Saville, Warden of
Merton College, ordered that the room, or place of stowage,
for books, should be new planked, and that benches and
repositories <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: for">fo</span> books should be
set up." Wood's <i>Annals of the University</i>, vol. ii., pt.
ii., p. 920. The worthy founder then pursued his epistolary
intercourse with the Vice-Chancellor:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">"<i>To Mr. Vice Chancellor.</i></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="letter">I find myself greatly beholden unto you for the speed that
you have used in proposing my offer to the whole University,
which I also hear by divers friends was greatly graced in
their meeting with your courteous kind speeches. And though
their answer of acceptance were over thankful and
respective; yet I take it unto me for a singular comfort,
that it came for that affection, whose thanks in that behalf
I do esteem a great deal more than they have reason to
esteem a far better offer. In which respect I have returned
my dutiful acknowledgement, which I beseech you to present,
when you shall call a convocation, about some matter of
greater moment. Because their letter was in <i>Latin</i>,
methought it did enforce me not to show myself a truant, by
attempting the like, with a pen out of practice: which yet I
hope they will excuse with a kind construction of my
meaning. And to the intent they may perceive that my good
will is as forward to perform as to promise, and that I
purpose to shew it to their best contentation, I do hold it
very requisite that some few should be deputed by the rest
of the House to consider, for the whole, of the fittest kind
of facture of desks, and other furniture; and when I shall
come to Oxford, which I determine, God willing, some time
before Easter, I will then acquaint the self same parties
with some notes of a platform, which I and Mr. Savile have
conceived here between us: so that, meeting altogether, we
shall soon resolve upon the best, as well for shew, and
stately form, as for capacity and strength, and commodity of
students. Of this my motion I would pray you to take some
notice in particular, for that my letter herewith to your
public assembly doth refer itself in part to your delivery
of my mind. My chiefest care is now, the while, how to
season my timber as soon as possible. For that which I am
offered by the special favour of Merton College, although it
were felled a great while since, yet of force it will
require, after time it is sawed, a convenient seasoning;
least by making too much haste, if the shelves and seats
should chance to warp, it might prove to be an eye sore, and
cost in a manner cast away. To gain some time in that
regard, I have already taken order for setting sawyers
a-work, and for procuring besides all other materials;
wherein my diligence and speed shall bear me witness of my
willingness to accomplish all that I pretend, to every man's
good liking. And thus I leave and commend you to God's good
tuition. From London, March 19, &mdash;97</p>

<p>A yet larger, and more complete, list will be found in Mr.
Gutch's publication of Wood's text. Let us next observe how
this distinguished bibliomaniac seized every
opportunity&mdash;laying embargoes upon barges and carriages&mdash;for
the conveyance of his book-treasures. The ensuing is also in
Mr. Gutch's work:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="letter">I have sent down, by a western barge, all the books that I
have of this year's collection, which I have requested Mr.
James, and other of my friends, to see safely brought from
Burcote, and placed in the library. Sir Francis Vere hath
sent me this year his accustomed annual gift of ten pounds.
The Lady Mary Vere, wife to Sir Horace Vere, in the time of
her widowhood (for so she is desired it should be recorded),
being called Mrs. Hoby, of Hales, in Gloucestershire, hath
given twenty pound. (He then enumerates about 15 other
donations, and thus goes on:) Thus I thought meet to observe
my yearly custom, in acquainting the University with the
increase of their store: as my care shall be next, and that
very shortly, to endow them with that portion of revenue and
land that I have provided, whensoever God shall call me, for
the full defraying of any charge that, by present
likelihood, the conservation of the books, and all needful
allowances to the keeper and others, may from time to time
require. I will send you, moreover, a draught of certain
statutes, which I have rudely conceived about the employment
of that revenue, and for the government of the library: not
with any meaning that they should be received, as orders
made by me (for it shall appear unto you otherwise) but as
notes and remembrances to abler persons, whom hereafter you
may nominate (as I will also then request you) to consider
of those affairs, and so frame a substantial form of
government, sith that which is a foot is in many thinges
defective for preservation of the library: for I hold it
altogether fitting that the University Convocation should be
always possessed of an absolute power to devise any
statutes, and of those to alter as they list, when they find
an occasion of evident utility. But of these and other
points, when I send you my project, I will both write more
of purpose, and impart unto you freely my best cogitations,
being evermore desirous, whatsoever may concern your public
good, to procure and advance it so, to the uttermost of my
power: as now in the meanwhile, reminding unto you my

<p>
In a letter to his "dearest friends, Doctor Kinge,
Vice-Chancellor, the Doctors, Proctors, and the rest of the
Convocation House in Oxon," (16th June, 1609) after telling
them how he had secured certain landed property for the
payment of the salaries and other expenses attendant upon
the library, Sir Thomas thus draws to a conclusion: "Now
because I presuppose that you take little pleasure in a
tedious letter, having somewhat besides to impart unto you,
I have made it known by word to Mr. Vicechancellor, who, I
know, will not fail to acquaint you with it: as withall I
have intreated him to supply, in my behalf, all my negligent
omissions, and defective form of thanks, for all your public
honours, entertainments, letters, gifts, and other graces
conferred upon me, which have so far exceeded the compass of
my merits that, where before I did imagine that nothing
could augment my zealous inclination to your general good,
now methinks I do feel it (as I did a great while since) was
very highly augmented: insomuch as I cannot but shrive
myself thus freely and soothly unto you. That, albeit, among
a number of natural imperfections, I have least of all
offended in the humour of ambition, yet now so it is, that I
do somewhat repent me of my too much niceness that way: not
as carried with an appetite to rake more riches to myself
(wherein, God is my witness, my content is complete) but
only in respect of my greedy desire to make a livelier
demonstration of the same that I bear to my <span class="smcap">common mother</span>,
than I have hitherto attained sufficient ability to put in
execution. With which unfeigned testification of my devotion
unto you, and with my daily fervent prayers for the endless
prosperity of your joint endeavours, in that whole
institution of your public library, I will close up this
letter, and rest, as I shall ever,</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 2em;">Yours, in all loving and dutiful affection,</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Thomas Bodley</span>.</p>

<p>London, May 31, 1609."</p>

<p>The following, which is also in Mr. Gutch's publication,
shews the laudable restlessness, and insatiable ambition, of
our venerable bibliomaniac, in ransacking foreign libraries
for the completion of his own.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="letter">About some three years past, I made a motion, here in
London, to Mr. Pindar, Consul of the Company of English
Merchants at Aleppo (a famous port in the Turk's dominions)
that he would use his best means to procure me some books in
the Syriac, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian tongues, or in any
other language of those Eastern nations: because I make no
doubt but, in process of time, by the extraordinary
diligence of some one or other student, they may be readily
understood, and some special use made of their kind of
learning in those parts of the world: and where I had a
purpose to reimburse all the charge that might grow
thereupon, he sent of late unto me 20 several volumes in the
foresaid tongues, and of his liberal disposition hath
bestowed them freely on the library. They are manuscripts
all (for in those countries they have no kind of printing)
and were valued in that place at a very high rate. I will
send them, ere be long, praying you the while to notify so
much unto the University, and to move them to write a letter
of thanks, which I will find means to convey to his hands,
being lately departed from London to Constantinople. Whether
the letter be indited in Latin or English, it is not much
material, but yet, in my conceit, it will do best to him in
English."</p>
</div>

<p>(The remainder of this letter is devoted to a scheme of
building the public schools at Oxford; in which Sir Thomas
found a most able and cheerful coadjutor, in one, <i>Sir Jo.
Benet</i>; who seems to have had an extensive and powerful
connection, and who set the scheme on foot, "like a true
affected son to his <span class="smcap">ancient mother</span>, with a cheerful
propension to take the charge upon him without groaning.")
</p><p>
In April 1585, Queen Elizabeth granted Sir Thomas "a
passport of safe conveyance to Denmark"; and wrote a letter
to the King of Denmark of the same date, within two days.
She wrote, also, a letter to Julius, Duke of Brunswick of
the same date: in which the evils that were then besetting
the Christian world abroad were said to be rushing suddenly,
as "from the Trojan Horse." "These three letters (observes
Mr. Baker to his friend Hearne) are only copies, but very
fairly wrote, and seem to have been duplicates kept by him
that drew the original letters."
</p><p>
We will peruse but two more of these Bodleian epistles,
which Hearne very properly adds as an amusing appendix, as
well to the foregoing, as to his <i>Reliquiæ Bodleianæ</i> (1703,
8vo). They are written to men whose names must ever be held
in high veneration by all worthy bibliomanacs.

I am persuaded he cannot any way receive a greater

that purpose. And remember I give you fair warning that if
you hold any book so dear as that you would be loth to have
him out of your sight, set him aside before hand. For my own
part, I will not do that wrong to my judgment as to chuse of
the worst, if better be in place: and, beside, you would
account me a simple man.

But to leave jesting, we will any of the days come to you,

<p>It only remains now to indulge the dutiful sons of <span class="smcap">Alma
Mater</span> with a fac-simile wood-cut impression of the profile
of the venerable founder of the Bodleian Library, taken from
a print of a medal in the <i>Catalogi Librorum Manuscriptorum
Angliæ, &amp;c.</i>, 1697, fol.; but whether it have any
resemblance to the bust of him, "carved to the life by an
excellent hand at London, and shortly after placed in a
niche in the south wall of the same library," with the
subjoined inscription, I cannot at this moment recollect.

<p>The library of Sir Thomas Bodley, when completed, formed the
figure of a T: it was afterwards resolved, on the books
accumulating, and the benefactions increasing, to finish it
in the form of an H; in which state it now remains. Sir
Kenelm Digby, like a thorough bred bibliomaniac, "gave fifty
very good oaks, to purchase a piece of ground of Exeter
College, laying on the north west side of the library; on
which, and their own ground adjoining, they might erect the
future fabric." The laying of the foundation of this
erection is thus described by Wood; concluding with a
catastrophe, at which I sadly fear the wicked reader will
smile. "On the thirteenth of May, being Tuesday, 1634, the
Vice-chancellor, Doctors, Heads of Houses, and Proctors, met
at St. Mary's church about 8 of the clock in the morning;
thence each, having his respective formalities on came to
this place, and took their seats that were then erected on
the brim of the foundation. Over against them was built a
scaffold, where the two proctors, with divers masters,
stood. After they were all settled, the University
Musicians, who stood upon the leads at the west end of the
library, sounded a lesson on their wind music. Which being
done, the singing men of Christ-Church, with others, sang a
lesson, after which the senior Proctor, Mr. Herbert Pelham,
of Magdalen College, made an eloquent oration: that being
ended also, the music sounded again, and continued playing
till the Vice-Chancellor went to the bottom of the
foundation to lay the first stone in one of the south
angles. <img src="images/oxfordarms.png" width="217" height="299" alt="DOMINVS ILLVMINATIO MEA" title="DOMINVS ILLVMINATIO MEA" class="floatl" />But no sooner had he deposited a piece of gold on
the said stone, according to the usual manner in such
ceremonies, but the earth fell in from one side of the
foundation, and the scaffold that was thereon broke and fell
with it; so that all those that were thereon, to the number
of a hundred at least, namely, the Proctors, Principals of
Halls, Masters, and some Bachelaurs, fell down all together,
one upon another, into the foundation; among whom, the under
butler of Exeter College had his shoulder broken or put out
of joint, and a scholar's arm bruised." "The solemnity being
thus concluded with such a sad catastrophe, the breach was
soon after made up and the work going chearfully forward,
was in four years space finished." <i>Annals of the University
of Oxford</i>; vol. ii., pt. ii., p. 939. Gutch's edition. We
will take leave of <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas Bodley</span>, and of his noble
institution, with the subjoined representation of the
University's Arms&mdash;as painted upon the ceiling of the
library, in innumerable compartments; hoping that the period
is not very remote when a <i>History of the Bodleian Library</i>,
more ample and complete than any thing which has preceded
it, will appear prefixed to a <i>Catalogue of the Books</i>, like

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Very good. And pray favour us with the result of your profound

that these worthy characters were not lampooned by some sharp-set

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Yes, verily: and I warrant some half-starved scrivener of the

satirist, Prynne; but I ought not thus to cuff him, for fear of
bringing upon me the united indignation of a host of black-letter
critics and philologists. A <i>large and clean</i> copy of his sorrily
printed work is among the choicest treasures of a Shakspearian

better judgments to our book-passions. After all, Stubbes's
work is a caricatured drawing. It has strong passages, and a
few original thoughts; and, is moreover, one of the very few
works printed in days of yore which have running titles to
the subjects discussed in them. These may be recommendations
with the bibliomaniac; but he should be informed that this
volume contains a great deal of puritanical cant, and
licentious language; that vices are magnified in it in order
to be lashed, and virtues diminished that they might not be
noticed. Stubbes equals Prynne in his anathemas against
"Plays and Interludes:" and in his chapters upon "Dress" and
"Dancing" he rakes together every coarse and pungent phrase
in order to describe "these horrible sins" with due
severity. He is sometimes so indecent that, for the credit
of the age, and of a virgin reign, we must hope that every
virtuous dame threw the copy of his book, which came into
her possession, behind the fire. This may reasonably account
for its present rarity. I do not discover it in the

Brodum, circulated within the system, and put all the generous juices
in action. The niggardly collector felt the influence of rivalship; he
played a deeper stake at book-gambling; and hastened, by his painfully
acquired knowledge of what was curious and rare in books, to
anticipate the rustic collector&mdash;which latter, putting the best wheels

parts; 1595, folio: first part containing 123 pages,
exclusive of three preliminary epistles: the second, 27
pages; exclusive of three similar introductory pieces. The
<i>first part</i> is devoted entirely to Divinity: and in the
dedicatory epistle to Queen Elizabeth, Maunsell tells her
majesty that he thought it "worth his poor labour to collect
a catalogue of the divine books, so mightily increased in
her reign; whereby her majesty's most faithful and loving
subjects may be put in remembrance of the works of so
excellent authors," &amp;c. The second part is devoted to a
brief account of books in the remaining branches of
literature, arts, sciences, &amp;c. Maunsell promised to follow
it up by a <i>third</i> part; but a want of due encouragement
seems to have damped the bibliographical ardour of the
compiler; for this third part never appeared: a circumstance
which, in common with the late Mr. Steevens, all
bibliomaniacs may "much lament." See the <i>Athenæum</i>, vol i.,
155; also Herbert's <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, vol ii., p.

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_344_350" id="Footnote_344_350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_344_350">[344]</a> The <span class="smcap">History</span> of the <span class="smcap">Education of Youth</span> in this
country might form an amusing little octavo volume. We have
<i>Treatises</i> and <i>Essays</i> enough upon the subject; but a
narrative of its first rude efforts, to its present, yet not
perfected, form, would be interesting to every parent, and
observer of human nature. My present researches only enable
me to go back as far as Trevisa's time, towards the close of
the 14th century; when I find, from the works of this Vicar
of Berkeley, that "every friar that had <i>state in school</i>,
such as they were then, had an <span class="smcap">huge library</span>." <i>Harl. MSS.</i>,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 1900. But what the particular system was, among
youth, which thus so highly favoured the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>, I have
not been able to ascertain. I suspect, however, that
knowledge made but slow advances; or rather that its
progress was almost inverted; for, at the end of the
subsequent century, our worthy printer, Caxton, tells us
that he found "but few who could write in their registers
the occurrences of the day." <i>Polychronicon; prol. Typog.
Antiquit.</i>, vol. i., 148. In the same printer's prologue to
<i>Catho Magnus</i> (<i>Id.</i>, vol. i., 197) there is a melancholy
complaint about the youth of London; who, although, when
children, they were "fair, wise, and prettily bespoken&mdash;at
the full ripening, they had neither kernel nor good corn
found in them." This is not saying much for the academic or
domestic treatment of young gentlemen, towards the close of
the 15th century. At the opening of the ensuing century, a
variety of elementary treatises, relating to the education
of youth, were published chiefly under the auspices of Dean
Colet, and composed by a host of learned grammarians, of
whom honourable mention has been made at <a href="#Page_218">page 218</a>, ante.
These publications are generally adorned with a rude
wood-cut; which, if it be copied from truth, affords a
sufficiently striking proof of the severity of the ancient
discipline: for the master is usually seated in a large
arm-chair, with a tremendous rod across his knees; and the
scholars are prostrate before him, either on the ground upon
bended knees, or sitting upon low benches. Nor was this
rigid system relaxed in the middle of the same (xvi<span class="super">th</span>)
century; when Roger Ascham composed his incomparable
treatise, intitled the "<i>Schoolmaster</i>;" the object of which
was to decry the same severity of discipline. This able
writer taught his countrymen the value of making the road to
knowledge smooth and inviting, by smiles and remunerations,
rather than by stripes and other punishments. Indeed, such
was the stern and Draco-like character which schoolmasters
of this period conceived themselves authorized to assume
that neither rank, nor situation, nor sex, were exempt from
the exercise of their tyranny. Lady Jane Grey tells Ascham
that her former teacher used to give her "pinches, and
cuffs, and bobs," &amp;c. The preface to the Schoolmaster
informs us that two gentlemen, who dined with Ascham at
Cecil's table, were of opinion that <span class="smcap">Nicolas Udal</span>, then head
master of Eaton School, "was the best schoolmaster of their
time, and the <i>greatest beater</i>!" Bishop Latimer, in his
fourth sermon (edit. 1562, fol. 15 to 18), has drawn such a
picture of the Londoners of this period that the philosopher
may imagine that youths, who sprung from such parents,
required to be ruled with a rod of iron. But it has been the
fashion of all writers, from the age of St. Austin
downwards, to depreciate the excellences, and magnify the
vices, of the times in which they lived. Ludovicus Vives,
who was Latimer's contemporary, has attacked both
schoolmasters and youths, in an ungracious style; saying of
the former that "some taught Ovid's books of love to their
scholars, and some make expositions and expounded the
vices." He also calls upon the young women, in the language
of St. Jerome, "to avoid, as a mischief or poison of
chastity, young men with heads bushed and trimmed; and sweet
smelling skins of outlandish mice." <i>Instruction of a
Christian Woman</i>; edit. 1592, sign. D 3, rect. &amp;c. I am not
aware of any work of importance, relating to the education
of youth, which appeared till the publication of the
<i>Compleat Gentleman</i> by <span class="smcap">Henry Peacham</span>: an author, who richly
deserves all the handsome things above said of him in the
text. His chapters "<i>Of the Duty of Masters</i>," and "<i>Of the
Duty of Parents</i>," are valuable upon many accounts: inasmuch
as they afford curious anecdotes of the system of academic
and domestic education then pursued, and are accompanied
with his own sagacious and candid reflections. Peacham was
an <i>Aschamite</i> in respect to lenity of discipline; as the
following extracts, from the foregoing work, (edit. 1661)
will unequivocally prove. Peacham first observes upon the
different modes of education: "But we see on the contrary,
out of the master's carterly judgment, like horses in a
team, the boys are set to draw all alike, when some one or
two prime and able wits in the school,
<span lang="el" title="Greek: auto didaktoi">&#8048;&#965;&#964;&#959; &#948;&#8055;&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#953;</span> (which he culs out to admiration if strangers
come, as a costardmonger his fairest pippins) like fleet
hovnds go away with the game, when the rest need helping
over a stile a mile behind: hence, being either quite
discouraged in themselves, or taken away by their friends
(who for the most part measure their learning by the form
they set in), they take leave of their books while they
live," &amp;c. p. 23. "Some affect, and severer schools enforce,
a precise and tedious strictness, in long keeping the
schollers by the walls: as from before six in the morning,
till twelve or past: so likewise in the afternoon. Which,
beside the dulling of the wit and dejecting the spirit (for,
"otii non minus quam negotii ratio extare debet") breeds in
him, afterwards, a kind of hate and carelessness of study
when he comes to be "sui juris," at his own liberty (as
experience proves by many, who are sent from severe schools
unto the universities): withall over-loading his memory, and
taking off the edge of his invention, with over heavy tasks,
in themes, verses," &amp;c., p. 25. "Nor is it my meaning that I
would all masters to be tyed to one method, no more than all
the shires of England to come up to London by one highway:
there may be many equally alike good. And since method, as
one saith, is but <span lang="el" title="Greek: odopoiêtikê">&#8000;&#948;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8052;</span>, let every master, if
he can, by pulling up stiles and hedges, make a more near
and private way to himself; and in God's name say, with the
divinest of poets,</p>

<p>But instead of many good, they have infinite bad; and go
stumbling from the right, as if they went blindfold for a
wager. Hence cometh the shifting of the scholler from master
to master; who, poor boy (like a hound among a company of
ignorant hunters hollowing every deer they see), misseth the
right, begetteth himself new labour, and at last, by one of
skill and well read, beaten for his paines," pp. 29, 30.
Peacham next notices the extreme severity of discipline
exercised in some schools. "I knew one, who in winter would
ordinarily, in a cold morning, whip his boys over for no
other purpose than to get himself a heat: another beats them
for swearing, and all the while sweares himself with
horrible oaths. He would forgive any fault saving that! I
had, I remember, myself (neer St. Alban's in Hertfordshire,
where I was born) a master, who, by no entreaty, would teach
any scholler he had farther than his father had learned
before him; as if he had only learned but to read English,
the son, though he went with him seven years, should go no
further: his reason was, they would then prove saucy rogues,
and controle their fathers! Yet these are they that
oftentimes have our hopefull gentry under their charge and
tuition, to bring them up in science and civility!" p. 27.
This absurd system is well contrasted with the following
account of the lenity observed in some of the schools on the
continent: "In Germany the school is, and as the name
imports, it ought to be, merely, <span class="smcap">Ludus literarius</span>, a very
pastime of learning, where it is a rare thing to see a rod
stirring: yet I heartily wish that our children of England
were but half so ready in writing and speaking Latin, which
boys of ten and twelve years old will do so roundly, and
with so neat a phrase and style, that many of our masters
would hardly mend them; having only for their punishment,
shame; and for their reward, praise," p. 24. "Wherefore I
cannot but commend the custome of their schools in the
Low-countries, where for the avoyding of this tedious
sitting still, and with irksome poring on the book all day
long, after the scholler hath received his lecture, he
leaveth the school for an houre, and walkes abroad with one
or two of his fellows, either into the field or up among the
trees upon the rampire, as in <span class="smcap">Antwerp</span>, <span class="smcap">Breda</span>, <span class="smcap">Vtrecht</span>, &amp;c.,
when they confer and recreate themselves till time calls
them in to repeat, where perhaps they stay an hour; so
abroad again, and thus at their pleasure the whole day," p.
26. Thus have we pursued the <i>History of the Education of
Boys</i> to a period quite modern enough for the most
superficial antiquary to supply the connecting links down to
the present times. Nor can we conclude this prolix note
without observing upon two things which are remarkable
enough: first, that in a country like our own&mdash;the
distinguishing characteristics of whose inhabitants are
gravity, reserve, and good sense&mdash;lads should conduct
themselves with so much rudeness, flippancy, and tyranny
towards each other&mdash;and secondly, that masters should, in
too many instances, exercise a discipline suited rather to a
government of despotism and terror than to a land of liberty
and social comfort! But all human improvement, and human
happiness, is progressive. Speramus meliora!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> What your newspaper may hold forth I will not pretend to enter

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Nay, here is the paragraph; which I cut out from "<i>The

announced the death of a schoolmaster in Suabia, who, for 51 years,
had superintended a large institution with old fashioned severity.
From an average, inferred by means of recorded observations, one of
the ushers had calculated that, in the course of his exertions, he had
given <i>911,500 canings, 121,000 floggings, 209,000 custodes, 136,000
tips with the ruler, 10,200 boxes on the ear, and 22,700 tasks by
heart</i>. It was further calculated that he had made <i>700 boys stand on
peas, 6000 kneel on a sharp edge of wood, 5000 wear the fool's cap,
and 1,700 hold the rod</i>. How vast (exclaims the journalist) the
quantity of human misery inflicted by a single perverse educator!"
Now, my friends, what have you to say against the <i>English</i> system of
education?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> This is only defending bad by worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Where are we digressing? What are become of our bibliomaniacal

<span class="smcap">Robert Burton</span> being a collector of "ancient popular little
pieces." From this authority we find that he gave "a great
variety" of these pieces, with a multitude of books, of the
best kind, to the "Bodleian Library."&mdash;One of these was that
"opus incomparabile," the "<i>History of Tom Thumb</i>," and the
other, the "<i>Pleasant and Merry History of the Mylner of

<p>And see, gentle reader, how the charms of solitude&mdash;of
"walking alone in some solitary grove, betwixt wood and
water, by a brook-side, to meditate upon some delightsome
and pleasant subject" are depicted by the truly original
pencil of this said Robert Burton, in his <i>Anatomy of
Melancholy</i>, vol. i., p. 126, edit. 1804. But our theme is
Bibliomania. Take, therefore, concerning the same author,
the following: and then hesitate, if thou canst, about his
being infected with the <span class="smcap">book-disease</span>. "What a catalogue of
new books all this year, all this age (I say) have our
Frank-furt marts, our domestic marts, brought out! Twice a
year, 'Proferunt se nova ingenia et ostentant;' we stretch
our wits out! and set them to sale: 'Magno conatu nihil
agimus,' &amp;c. 'Quis tam avidus librorum helluo,' who can read
them? As already, we shall have a vast chaos and confusion
of books; we are oppressed with them; our eyes ake with
reading, our fingers with turning," &amp;c. This is painting <i>ad
vivum</i>&mdash;after the life. We see and feel every thing
described. Truly, none but a thorough master in
bibliomaniacal mysteries could have thus thought and
written! See "<i>Democritus to the Reader</i>," p. 10; perhaps
the most highly finished piece of dissection in the whole

the reader has already had some slight mention made at pages
<a href="#Page_273">273</a>, <a href="#Page_281">281</a>, ante. Of <span class="smcap">Henry Hastings</span>, Gilpin has furnished us
with some anecdotes which deserve to be here recorded. They
are taken from Hutchin's <i>Hist. of Dorsetshire</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 63. "Mr. <span class="smcap">Hastings</span> was low of stature, but strong and
active, of a ruddy complexion, with flaxen hair. His cloaths
were always of green cloth. His house was of the old
fashion; in the midst of a large park, well stocked with
deer, rabbits, and fish-ponds. He had a long narrow bowling
green in it, and used to play with round sand bowls. Here
too he had a banquetting room built, like a stand in a large
tree. He kept all sorts of hounds, that ran buck, fox, hare,
otter, and badger; and had hawks of all kinds, both long and
short winged. His great hall was commonly strewed with
marrow-bones, and full of hawk-perches, hounds, spaniels,
and terriers. The upper end of it was hung with fox-skins of
this and the last year's killing. Here and there a pole-cat
was intermixed, and hunter's poles in great abundance. The
parlour was a large room, completely furnished in the same
style. On a broad hearth, paved with brick, lay some of the
choicest terriers, hounds, and spaniels. One or two of the
great chairs had litters of cats in them, which were not to
be disturbed. Of these, three or four always attended him at
dinner, and a little white wand lay by his trencher, to
defend it, if they were too troublesome. In the windows,
which were very large, lay his arrows, cross-bows, and other
accoutrements. The corners of the room were filled with his
best hunting and hawking poles. His oyster table stood at
the lower end of the room, which was in constant use twice a
day, all the year round; for he never failed to eat oysters
both at dinner and supper, with which the neighbouring town
of Pool supplied him. At the upper end of the room stood a
small table with a double desk; one side of which held a
<span class="smcap">Church Bible</span>: the other the <span class="smcap">Book of Martyrs</span>. On different
tables in the room lay hawks'-hoods, bells, old hats, with
their crowns thrust in, full of pheasant eggs, tables, dice,
cards, and store of tobacco pipes. At one end of this room
was a door, which opened into a closet, where stood bottles
of strong beer and wine; which never came out but in single
glasses, which was the rule of the house, for he never
exceeded himself, nor permitted others to exceed. Answering
to this closet was a door into an old chapel; which had been
long disused for devotion; but in the pulpit, as the safest
place, was always to be found a cold chine of beef, a
venison pasty, a gammon of bacon, or a great apple-pye, with
thick crust, well baked. His table cost him not much, though
it was good to eat at. His sports supplied all but beef and
mutton, except on Fridays, when he had the best of fish. He
never wanted a London pudding, and he always sang it in with
"<i>My part lies therein-a</i>." He drank a glass or two of wine
at meals; put syrup of gilly-flowers into his sack, and had
always a tun glass of small beer standing by him, which he
often stirred about with rosemary. He lived to be an
hundred, and never lost his eyesight, nor used spectacles.
He got on horseback without help, and rode to the death of
the stag till he was past fourscore." Gilpin's <i>Forest
Scenery</i>, vol. ii., pp. 23, 26. I should add, from the same
authority, that Hastings was a neighbour of Anthony Ashley
Cooper, Earl of Shaftesbury, with whom (as was likely
enough) he had no cordial agreement.</p>

fortunate termination. His "opus maximum" is the <i>Order of the

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_349_355" id="Footnote_349_355"></a><a href="#FNanchor_349_355">[349]</a> It remains here to make good the above
serious charges brought against the ancient and worthy
family of the <span class="smcap">Ferrars</span>; and this it is fully in my power to
do, from the effectual aid afforded me by Dr. Wordsworth, in
the fifth volume of his <i>Ecclesiastical Biography</i>; where
the better part of Dr. Peckard's Life of Nicholas Ferrar is
published, together with some valuable and original addenda
from the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth. Be it, however,
known to Dr. Wordsworth, and the reviewer of the
Ecclesiastical Biography in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol.
iv., pp. 93, 103, that Hearne had previously published a
copious and curious account of the monastery at Little
Gidding in the supplement to his <i>Thom. Caii. Vind.
Antiquit. Oxon.</i>, 1730, 8vo., vol. ii.: which, as far as I
have had an opportunity of examining Dr. Wordsworth's
account, does not appear to have been known to this latter
editor. We will now proceed to the bibliomaniacal anecdotes
of <span class="smcap">Nicholas Ferrar, senior and junior</span>. "Amongst other
articles of instruction and amusement, Mr. <span class="smcap">Ferrar</span> (senior)
entertained an ingenious <i>Book-binder</i> who taught the
family, females as well as males, the whole art and skill of
<i>book-binding</i>, gilding, lettering, and what they called
pasting-printing, by the use of the rolling press. By this
assistance he composed a full harmony, or concordance, of
the four evangelists, <i>adorned with many beautiful
pictures</i>, which required more than a year for the
composition, and was divided into 150 heads or chapters."
There is then a minute account of the mechanical process (in
which the nieces assisted) how, by means of "great store of
the best and strongest white paper, nice knives and
scissars, pasting and rolling-press" work&mdash;the arduous task
was at length accomplished: and Mary Collet, one of Mr.
Ferrar's nieces, put the grand finishing stroke to the
whole, by "doing a deed"&mdash;which has snapt asunder the
threads of Penelope's web for envy:&mdash;"She bound the book
entirely, <span class="smcap">all wrought in gold</span>, in a new and most elegant
fashion." The fame of this book, or concordance, as it was
called, reached the ears of Charles I., who "intreated"
(such was his Majesty's expression) to be favoured with a
sight of it. Laud and Cousins, who were then chaplains in
waiting, presented it to the King; who "after long and
serious looking it over, said, 'This is indeed a most
valuable work, and in many respects to be presented to the
greatest prince upon earth: for the matter it contains is
the richest of all treasures. The laborious composure of it
into this excellent form of <i>an Harmony</i>, the judicious
contrivance of the method, the curious workmanship in so
neatly cutting out and disposing the text, <i>the nice laying
of these costly pictures, and the exquisite art expressed in
the binding</i>, are, I really think, not to be equalled. I
must acknowledge myself to be, indeed, greatly indebted to
the family for <span class="smcap">this jewel</span>: and whatever is in my power I
shall, at any time, be ready to do for any of them.'"
<i>Eccles. Biogr.</i>, vol. v., 172-8. This was spoken, by
Charles, in the true spirit of a Book-Knight! Cromwell, I
suppose, would have shewn the same mercy to this treasure as
he did to the madonnas of Raffaelle&mdash;thrown it behind the
fire, as idolatrous! The nephew emulated and eclipsed the
bibliomaniacal celebrity of his uncle. At the age of
twenty-one, he executed three books (or "works" as they are
called) of uncommon curiosity and splendour. Archbishop
Laud, who had a keen eye and solid judgment for things of
this sort (as the reader will find in the following pages)
undertook to introduce young Ferrars to the King. The
introduction is told in such a pleasing style of <i>naiveté</i>,
and the manual dexterity of the young bibliomaniac is so
smartly commended by Charles, that I cannot find it in my
heart to abridge much of the narrative. "When the king saw
the Archbishop enter the room, he said, 'What have you
brought with you those <i>rarities</i> and <i>jewels</i> you told me
of?' 'Yea, sire,' replied the bishop; 'here is the <span class="smcap">young
gentleman</span> and his works.' So the bishop, taking him by the
hand, led him up to the king. He, falling down on his knees,
the king gave him his hand to kiss, bidding him rise up. The
box was opened, and <span class="smcap">Nicholas Ferrar</span>, first presented to the
king that book made for the prince; who taking it from him,
looking well on the outside, which was <i>all green velvet,
stately and richly gilt all over, with great broad strings,
edged with gold lace, and curiously bound</i>, said, 'Here is a
fine book for Charles, indeed! I hope it will soon make him
in love with what is within it, for I know it is good,' &amp;c.
And lo! here are also store of <i>rare pictures</i> to delight
his eye with! &amp;c., &amp;c. Then, turning him to the Lord of
Canterbury, he said, 'Let this young gentleman have your
letters to the princes to-morrow, to Richmond, and let him
carry this present. It is a good day, you know, and a good
work would be done upon it.' So he gave Nicholas Ferrar the
book; who, carrying it to the box, took out of it a very
large paper book, which was the <span class="smcap">Fourth Work</span>, and laid it on
the table before the king. 'For whom,' said the king, 'is
this model?' 'For your majesty's eyes, if you please to
honour it so much.' 'And that I will gladly do,' said the
king, 'and never be weary of such sights as I know you will
offer unto me.' The king having well perused the title page,
beginning, 'The Gospel of our Lord and blessed Saviour,
Jesus Christ, in eight several languages,' &amp;c., said unto
the lords, 'You all see that one good thing produceth
another. Here we have more and more rarities; from print now
to pen. These are fair hands, well written, and as well
composed.' Then replied the Lord of Canterbury, 'When your
majesty hath seen all, you will have more and more cause to
admire.' 'What!' said the king, 'is it possible we shall
behold yet more rarities?' then said the bishop to Nicholas
Ferrar, 'Reach the other piece that is in the box:' and this
we call the <span class="smcap">Fifth Work</span>; the title being <i>Novum Testamentum,
&amp;c., in viginti quatuor linguis, &amp;c.</i> The king, opening the
book, said, 'Better and better. This is the largest and
fairest paper that ever I saw.' Then, reading the
title-page, he said, 'What is this? What have we here? The
incomparablest book this will be, as ever eye beheld. My
lords, come, look well upon it. This finished, must be the
<span class="smcap">Emperor of all Books</span>. It is the crown of all works. It is an
admirable masterpiece. The world cannot match it. I believe
you are all of my opinion.' The lords all seconded the king,
and each spake his mind of it. 'I observe two things amongst
others,' said the king, 'very remarkable, if not admirable.
The first is, how is it possible that a young man of
twenty-one years of age (for he had asked the Lord of
Canterbury before, how old Nicholas Ferrar was) should ever
attain to the understanding and knowledge of more languages
than he is of years; and to have the courage to venture upon
such an Atlas work, or Hercules labour. The other is also of
high commendation, to see him write so many several
languages, so well as these are, each in its proper
character. Sure so few years had been well spent, some men
might think, to have attained only to the <i>writing</i> thus
fairly, of these twenty-four languages!' All the lords
replied his majesty had judged right; and said, except they
had seen, as they did, the young gentleman there, and the
book itself, all the world should not have persuaded them to
the belief of it." <i>Ecclesiastical Biography</i>, vol. v., pp.
216, 220. But whatever degree of credit or fame of young
<span class="smcap">Ferrars</span> might suppose to have been attached to the execution
of these "pieces," his emulation was not damped, nor did his
industry slacken, 'till he had produced a specimen of much
greater powers of book-decoration. His appetite was that of
a giant; for he was not satisfied with any thing short of
bringing forth a volume of such dimensions as to make the
bearer of it groan beneath its weight&mdash;and the beholders of
it dazzled with its lustre, and astonished at its amplitude.
Perhaps there is not a more curious book-anecdote upon
record than the following. "Charles the 1st, his son
Charles, the Palsgrave, and the Duke of Lennox, paid a visit
to the monastery of Little Gidding, in Huntingdonshire&mdash;the
abode of the Ferrars."&mdash;"Then, the king was pleased to go
into the house, and demanded where the <span class="smcap">great book</span> was, that
he had heard was made for Charles's use. It was soon brought
unto him; and the <i>largeness</i> and <i>weight</i> of it was such
that he that carried it seemed to be <i>well laden</i>. Which the
duke, observing, said, 'Sir, one of your strongest guard
will but be able to carry this book.' It being laid on the
table before the king, it was told him that, though it were
then fairly bound up in <i>purple velvet</i>, that the outside
was not fully finished, as it should be, for the prince's
use and better liking. 'Well,' said the king, 'it is very
well done.' So he opened the book, the prince standing at
the table's end, and the Palsgrave and Duke on each side of
the king. The king read the title page and frontispice all
over very deliberately; and well viewing the form of it, how
adorned with <i>a stately garnish of pictures, &amp;c.</i>, and the
curiousness of the writing of it, said, 'Charles, here is a
book that contains excellent things. This will make you both
wise and good.' Then he proceeded to turn it over, leaf by
leaf, and took exact notice of all in it: and it being <i>full
of pictures of sundry mens cuts</i>, he could tell the
palsgrave, who seemed also to be knowing in that kind, that
this and this, and that and that, were of such a man's
graving and invention. The prince all the while greatly eyed
all things; and seemed much to be pleased with the book. The
king having spent some hours in the perusal of it, and
demanding many questions was occasion as, concerning the
contrivement, and having received answers to all he
demanded, at length said, 'It was only <i>a jewel for a
Prince</i>, and hoped <span class="smcap">Charles</span> would make good use of it: and I
see and find, by what I have myself received formerly from
this good house, that they go on daily in the prosecution of
these excellent pieces. They are brave employments of their
time.' The Palsgrave said to the prince, 'Sir, your father
the king is master of the goodliest ship in the world, and I
may now say you will be master of the <span class="smcap">gallantest greatest
book</span> in the world: for I never saw <i>such paper</i> before; and
believe there is no book of this largeness to be seen in
Christendom.' 'The paper and the book in all conditions,'
said the king, 'I believe it not to be matched. Here hath
also in this book not wanted, you see, skill, care, nor
cost.' 'It is a most admirable piece,' replied the Duke of
Richmond. So the king, closing the book, said, 'Charles,
this is yours.' He replied, 'But, Sir, shall I not now have
it with me?' Reply was made by one of the family, 'If it
please your highness, the book is not <i>on the outside so
finished</i> as it is intended for you, but shall be, with all
expedition, done, and you shall have it.' 'Well,' said the
king, 'you must content yourself for a
while.'"&mdash;<i>Ecclesiastical Biography</i>, vol. v., p. 237.</p>

posterity to be informed when Ashmole's "<i>great and little
teeth ached, or were loose</i>:" when his "<i>neck break forth,
occasioned by shaving his beard with a bad razor</i>" (p. 312);
when "<i>his maid's bed was on fire, but he rose quickly
(thanking God) and quenched it</i>" (p. 313); and when he
"<i>scratched the right-side of his buttocks, &amp;c., and applied
pultices thereunto, made of white bread crums, oil of roses,
and rose leaves</i>;" (p. 363&mdash;and see particularly the long
and dismal entries at p. 368.) All this might surely have
been spared, without much injury to the reputation of the
sufferer. Yet, in some other minute entries, we glean
intelligence a little more interesting. At p. 324, we find
that Ashmole had quarrelled with his wife; and that "Mr.
Serjeant Maynard observed to the Court that there were 800
sheets of depositions on his wife's part, and not one word
proved against him of using her ill, or ever giving her a
bad or provoking word:" at page 330, we find Ashmole
accompanying his heraldic friend Dugdale, in his
"visitations" of counties; also that "his picture was drawn
by Le Neve in his herald's coat:" Loggan afterwards drew it
in black lead: p. 352. But here again (p. 353) we are
gravely informed that "<i>his tooth, next his fore tooth in
his upper jaw, was very loose, and he easily pulled it out,
and that one of his middle teeth in his lower jaw, broke out
while he was at dinner</i>." He sat (for the last time) for "a
second picture to Mr. Ryley," p. 379. Ashmole's intimacy
with Lilly was the foundation of the former's (supposed)
profundity in alchemical and astrological studies. In this
Diary we are carefully told that "Mr. Jonas Moore brought
and acquainted him with Mr. William Lilly, on a Friday
night, on the 20th of November," p. 302. Ashmole was then
only 26 years of age; and it will be readily conceived how,
at this susceptible period, he listened with rapture to his
master's exposition of the black art, and implicitly adopted
the recipes and maxims he heard delivered. Hence the pupil
generally styled himself <i>Mercuriophilus Anglicus</i>, at the
foot of most of his title-pages: and hence we find such
extraordinary entries, in the foresaid diary, as the
following: "This night (August 14, 1651) about one of the
clock, I fell ill of a surfeit, occasioned by drinking
<i>water after Venison</i>. I was greatly oppressed in my
stomach; and next day Mr. Saunders, <i>the astrologian</i>, sent
me a piece of briony-root to hold in my hand; and within a
quarter of an hour my stomach was freed from that great
oppression," p. 314. "Sep. 27, 1652, I came to Mr. John
Tompson's, who dwelt near Dove Bridge; he used a call, and
had responses in a soft voice," p. 317. At p. 318 is
narrated the commencement of his acquaintance with the
famous Arise Evans, a Welsh prophet: whose "<i>Echo from
Heaven</i>," &amp;c., 2 parts, 1652, 12mo., is a work noticed by
Warburton, and coveted by bibliomaniacs. Yet one more
quack-medicine entry: "March 11, 1681. I took early in the
morning a good dose of Elixir, and hung three spiders about
my neck, and they drove my ague away&mdash;Deo gratias!" p. 359.
It seems that Ashmole always punctually kept "<i>The
Astrologer's Feast</i>;" and that he had such celebrity as a
curer of certain diseases, that Lord Finch the Chancellor
"sent for him to cure him of his rheumatism. He dined there,
but would not undertake the cure," p. 364. This was behaving
with a tolerable degree of prudence and good sense. But let
not the bibliomaniac imagine that it is my wish to degrade
honest old Elias Ashmole, by the foregoing delineation of
his weaknesses and follies. The ensuing entries, in the said
Diary, will more than counterbalance any unfavourable effect
produced by its precursors; and I give them with a full
conviction that they will be greedily devoured by those who
have been lucky enough to make good purchases of the entire
libraries of deceased characters of eminence. In his 37th
year, Ashmole "bought of Mr. Milbourn all his books and
mathematical instruments;" and the day after (N.B. "8
o'clock, 39 min. post merid.") "he bought Mr. Hawkins's
books," p. 312. In the ensuing year he "agreed with Mrs.
Backhouse, of London, for her deceased husband's books," p.
313. He now became so distinguished as a successful
bibliomaniac that Seldon and Twysden sought his
acquaintance; and "Mr. Tredescant and his wife told him that
they had been long considering upon whom to bestow their
<i>closet of curiosities</i>, and at last had resolved to give it
unto him," p. 326. Having by this time (A.D. 1658) commenced
his famous work upon <i>The Order of the Garter</i>, he was
introduced to Charles II.: kissed hands, and was appointed
by the king "to make a description of his medals, and had
them delivered into his hands, and <i>Henry the VIIIth's
closet</i> assigned for his use," p. 327. In this same year
came forth his "<i>Way to Bliss</i>;" 4to.: a work so invincibly
dull that I despair of presenting the reader with any thing
like entertainment even in the following heterogeneous
extract: "When our natural heat, the life of this little
world, is faint and gone, the body shrinks up and is
defaced: but bring again heat into the parts, and likewise
money into the bankrupt's coffers, and they shall be both
lusty, and flourish again as much as ever they did. But how
may this heat be brought again? To make few words, even as
she is kept and held by due <i>meat</i> and <i>motion</i>; for if she
faint, and falleth for want of them only, then give her
them, and she shall recover herself again. Meat is the bait
that draws her down: motion comes after, like a <i>Gad-Bee</i>,
to prick her forward; but the work is performed in this
order. First this meat, which is that fine and æthereal oyl
often above-described, by the exceeding piercing swifteness,
divides, scatters, and scowres away the gross and foul dregs
and leavings which, for want of the tillage of heat, had
overgrown in our bodies, and which was cast, like a blockish
stay-fish in the way, to stay the free course of the ship of
life: these flying out of all sides, abundantly pluck up all
the old leavings of hair, nails, and teeth, by the roots,
and drive them out before them: in the mean while, our
medicine makes not onely clear way and passage for life, if
she list to stir and run her wonted race (which some think
enough of this matter), but also scattereth all about her
due and desired meat, and first moisture to draw her
forward. By which means our life, having gotten both her
full strength and liveliness, and returned like the sun in
summer into all our quarters, begins to work afresh as she
did at first; (for being the same upon the same, she must
needs do the same) knitting and binding the weak and loose
joynts and sinews, watering and concocting all by good
digestion; and then the idle parts like leaves shall, in
this hot summer, spring and grow forth afresh, out of this
new and young temper of the body: and all the whole face and
shew shall be young again and flourishing," pp. 119, 120.
With such a farrago of sublime nonsense were our worthy
forefathers called upon to be enlightened and amused! But I
lose sight of Ashmole's <i>book-purchases</i>. That he gave away,
as well as received, curious volumes, is authenticated by
his gift of "five volumes of Mr. Dugdale's works to the
Temple Library:" p. 331. "Again: I presented the public
library at Oxford with three folio volumes, containing a
description of the Consular and Imperial coins there, which
I had formerly made and digested, being all fairly
transcribed with my own hand," p. 332. But mark well: "My
first boatful of books, which were carried to Mrs.
Tredescant's, were brought back to the Temple:" also, (May
1667) "I bought Mr. John Booker's study of books, and gave
140<i>l.</i> for them," p. 333. In the same year that his <i>Order
of the Garter</i> was published, his "good friend Mr. Wale sent
him Dr. <span class="smcap">Dee's</span> original books and papers," p. 339. But he yet
went on buying: "Nil actum reputans, dum quid superesset
agendum:" for thus journalises our super-eminent
bibliomaniac:&mdash;(June 12, 1681) "I bought Mr. Lilly's library
of books of his widow, for fifty pounds," p. 360. In August,
1682, Ashmole went towards Oxford, "to see the building
prepared to receive his rarities;" and in March, 1683, "the
last load of his rarities was sent to the barge." In July,
1687, he received a parcel of books from J.W. Irnhoff, of
Nurembergh, among which was his <i>Excellentium Familiarum in
Gallia Genealogia</i>: p. 379. But it is time to put an end to
this unwieldly note: reserving the account of Ashmole's
<i>Order of the Garter</i>, and <i>Theatrum Chemicum</i>, for the
ensuing one&mdash;and slightly informing the reader, of what he
may probably be apprized, that our illustrious bibliomaniac
bequeathed his museum of curiosities and library of books to
his beloved <span class="smcap">Alma Mater Oxoniensis</span>&mdash;having first erected a
large building for their reception. It is justly said of
him, in the inscription upon his tombstone,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Even so. But it must have been obtained in the golden age of

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> It was obtained, together with an uncut copy of his <i>Theatrum
Chemicum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_351_357" id="FNanchor_351_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_357" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> by my father, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span> shop of a most respectable
bookseller, lately living, at Mews-Gate, and now in Pall-Mall&mdash;where
the choicest copies of rare and beautiful books are oftentimes to be
procured, at a price much less than the extravagant ones given at
book-sales. You observed it was bound in blue morocco&mdash;and by that
Coryphæus of book-binders, the late <span class="smcap">Roger Payne</span>!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_351_357" id="Footnote_351_357"></a><a href="#FNanchor_351_357">[351]</a> First let us say a few words of the <span class="smcap">Theatrum
Chemicum Britannicum</span>, as it was the anterior publication. It
contains a collection of ancient English poetical pieces
relating to Alchemy, or the "Hermetique Mysteries;" and was
published in a neat quarto volume, in 1652; accompanied with
a rich sprinkling of plates "cut in brass," and copious
annotations, at the end, by Ashmole himself. Of these
plates, some are precious to the antiquary; for reasons
which will be given by me in another work. At present, all
that need be said is that a fine tall copy of it brings a
fair sum of money. I never heard of the existence of a
<i>large paper</i> impression. It went to press in July 1651; and
on the 26th of January following, "the first copy of it was
sold to the Earl of Pembroke:" see the Diary, pp. 313-315.
In May, 1658, Ashmole made his first visit to the Record
Office in the Tower, to collect materials for his work of
"<span class="smcap">The Order of the Garter</span>." In May following, Hollar
accompanied the author to Windsor, to take views of the
castle. In the winter of 1665, Ashmole composed a "good part
of the work at Roe-Barnes (the plague increasing)." In May,
1672, a copy of it was presented to King Charles II.: and in
June, the following year, Ashmole received "his privy-seal
for 400<i>l.</i> out of the custom of paper, which the king was
pleased to bestow upon him for the same." This, it must be
confessed, was a liberal remuneration. But the author's
honours increased and multiplied beyond his most sanguine
expectations. Princes and noblemen, abroad and at home, read
and admired his work; and Ashmole had golden chains placed
round his neck, and other superb presents from the greater
part of them; one of which (from the Elector of
Brandenburgh) is described as being "composed of ninety
links, of philagreen links in great knobs, most curious
work," &amp;c. In short, such was the golden harvest which
showered down upon him on all sides, on account of this
splendid publication, that "he made a feast at his house in
South Lambeth, in honour to his benefactors of the work of
<span class="smcap">the garter</span>." I hope he had the conscience to make <span class="smcap">Hollar</span> his
Vice-President, or to seat him at his right hand; for this
artist's <i>Engravings</i>, much more than the author's
composition, will immortalize the volume. Yet the
artist&mdash;died in penury! These particulars relating to this
popular work, which it was thought might be amusing to the
lover of fine books, have been faithfully extracted from the
'forementioned original and amusing Diary. <i>The Order of the
Garter</i> was originally sold for 1<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> See <i>Clavel's
Catalogue</i>, 1675, p. 31.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I observed it had a "glorious aspect," as bibliographers term
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> But what has become of Ashmole all this while?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I will only further remark of him that, if he had not suffered
his mind to wander in quest of the puzzling speculations of alchemy
and astrology&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span> he conceived himself bound to do in consequence,
probably, of wearing John Dee's red velvet night cap&mdash;he might have
mingled a larger portion of common sense and sound practical
observations in his writings.</p>

<p>But a truce to worthy old Elias. For see yonder the bibliomaniacal
spirit of <span class="smcap">Archbishop Laud</span> pacing your library! With one hand resting
upon a folio,<a name="FNanchor_352_358" id="FNanchor_352_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_358" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> it points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span> with the other, to your favourite print
of the public buildings of the University of Oxford&mdash;thereby reminding
us of his attachment, while living, to literature and fine books, and
of his benefactions to the Bodleian Library. Now it "looks frowningly"
upon us; and, turning round, and shewing the yet reeking gash from
which the life-blood flowed, it flits away&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_352_358" id="Footnote_352_358"></a><a href="#FNanchor_352_358">[352]</a> <span class="smcap">Archbishop Laud</span>, who
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: was">has</span> beheaded in the year 1644, had a great fondness for
sumptuous decoration in dress, books, and ecclesiastical
establishments; which made him suspected of a leaning
towards the Roman Catholic religion. His life has been
written by Dr. Heylin, in a heavy folio volume of 547 pages;
and in which we have a sufficiently prolix account of the
political occurrences during Laud's primacy, but rather a
sparing, or indeed no, account of his private life and
traits of domestic character. In Lloyd's <i>Memoirs of the
Sufferers</i> from the year 1637 to 1660 inclusive (1668, fol.)
are exhibited the articles of impeachment against the
Archbishop; and, amongst them, are the following
bibliomaniacal accusations. "Art. 5. Receiving a <i>Bible</i>,
with a crucifix embroidered on the cover of it by a lady.
Art. 6. A book of popish pictures, <i>two Missals</i>,
Pontificals, and Breviaries, which he made use of as a
scholar. Art. 7. His (own) admirable <i>Book of Devotion</i>,
digested according to the ancient way of canonical hours,
&amp;c. Art. 19. <i>The book of Sports</i>, which was published first
in King James his reign, before he had any power in the
church; and afterward in King Charles his reign, before he
had the chief power in the church," &amp;c., pp. 235-237. But if
Laud's head was doomed to be severed from his body in
consequence of these his bibliomaniacal frailties, what
would have been said to the fine copy of one of the
<i>Salisbury Primers or Missals</i>, printed by Pynson <span class="smcap">upon
vellum</span>, which once belonged to this archbishop, and is now
in the library of St. John's College, Oxford?! Has the
reader ever seen the same primate's copy of the <i>Aldine
Aristophanes</i>, 1498, in the same place? 'Tis a glorious
volume; and I think nearly equals my friend Mr. Heber's
copy, once Lord Halifax's, of the same edition. Of Laud's
benefactions to the Bodleian Library, the bibliographer will
see ample mention made in the <i>Catalogus Librorum
Manuscriptorum Angliæ, Hiberniæ</i>, &amp;c., 1697, folio. The
following, from Heylin, is worth extracting: "Being come
near the block, he (Laud) put off his doublet, &amp;c., and
seeing through the chink of the boards that some people were
got under the scaffold, about the very place where the block
was seated, he called to the officer for some dust to stop
them, or to remove the people thence; saying, it was no part
of his desire 'that his blood should fall upon the heads of
the people.' Never did man put off mortality with a better
courage, nor look upon his bloody and malicious enemies with
more christian charity." <i>Cyprianus Anglicus</i>; or the <i>Life
and Death of Laud</i>; 1668, fol.; p. 536. In the Master's
library at St. John's, Oxford, they shew the velvet cap
which it is said Laud wore at his execution; and in which
the mark of the axe is sufficiently visible. The archbishop
was a great benefactor to this college. Mr. H. Ellis, of the
Museum, who with myself were "quondam socii" of the same
establishment, writes me, that "Among what are called the
king's pamphlets in the British Museum, is a fragment of a
tract, without title, of fifty-six pages only, imperfect;
beginning, 'A briefe examination of a certaine pamphlet
lately printed in Scotland, and intituled <i>Ladensium
Autocatacrisis</i>,' &amp;c., 'The Cantabarians Self-Conviction.'
On the blank leaf prefixed, is the following remark in a
hand of the time. 'This Briefe Examen following, was found
in the Archbishop's (Laud?) Library, wher the whole
impression of these seauen sheets was found, but nether
beginning nor ending more then is hearein contained. May
11th, 1644.' This work, (continues Mr. Ellis,) which is a
singular and valuable curiosity, is in fact a personal
vindication of Archbishop Laud, not only from the slanders
of the pamphlet, but from those of the times in general: and
from internal evidence could have been written by no one but
himself. It is in a style of writing beyond that of the
ordinary productions of the day."</p>

<p class="bp">Perhaps Laud should have been noticed a little earlier in this list of
bibliomanical heroes; but, having here noticed him, I cannot refrain
from observing to you that the notorious <span class="smcap">Hugh Peters</span> revelled in some
of the spoils of the archbishop's library; and that there are, to the
best of my recollection, some curious entries on the journals of the
House of Commons relating to the same.<a name="FNanchor_353_359" id="FNanchor_353_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_359" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

gave me the intelligence which closes the last note, for the
ensuing particulars relating to <span class="smcap">Hugh Peters</span>; which are taken
from the journals of the lower house: "Ao. 1643-4. March 8.
Ordered, that a study of books, to the value of 100<i>l.</i> out
of such books as are sequestered, be forthwith bestowed upon
Mr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>." <i>Journals of the House of Commons</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 421. "Ao. 1644. 25 April. Whereas this House was formerly
pleased to bestow upon Mr. Peters books to the value of
100<i>l.</i>, it is this day ordered that Mr. Recorder, Mr.
Whitlock, Mr. Hill, or two of them, do cause to be delivered
to Mr. Peters, to the value of 100<i>l.</i>, books out of the
private and particular study of the <span class="smcap">Archbishop of
Canterbury</span>." <i>Id.</i>, vol. iii., p. 469. "Ao. 1644. 26 Junij.
Dies publicæ Humiliationis. Mr. Peters made a large and full
relation of the state of the western counties, and of the
proceedings of my Lord General's army, since its coming
thither," &amp;c. "Whereas, formerly, books to the amount of
100<i>l.</i> were bestowed upon Mr. Peters out of the
archbishop's private library, and whereas the said study is
appraised at above 40<i>l.</i> more than the 100<i>l.</i>, it is
ordered this day that Mr. Peters shall have the whole study
of books freely bestowed upon him." <i>Id.</i> p. 544. "Ao. 1660.
May 16. Ordered, That all books and papers, heretofore
belonging to the library of the archbishop of Canterbury,
and now, or lately, in the hands of Mr. <span class="smcap">Hugh Peters</span>, be
forthwith secured." In Ashmole's life, before the first
volume of his Antiq. of Berkshire, it is said in Aug. 1660,
"Mr. Ashmole had a commission to examine that infamous
buffoon and trumpeter of rebellion, Hugh Peters, concerning
the disposal of the pictures, jewels, &amp;c., belonging to the
royal family, which were committed chiefly to his care, and
sold and dispersed over Europe: which was soon brought to a
conclusion by the obstinacy or ignorance of their criminal,
who either would not, or was not able to, give the desired
satisfaction."</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> This is extraordinary enough. But, if I well remember, you
mentioned, a short time ago, the name of <span class="smcap">Braithwait</span> as connected with
that of Peacham. Now, as I <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: presume">persume</span>
Lorenzo has not tied down his guests to any rigid chronological rules,
in their literary chit-chat, so I presume you might revert to
Braithwait, without being taxed with any great violation of colloquial
order.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Nay, I am not aware of any <i>bookish</i> anecdote concerning
Braithwait. He was mentioned with Peacham as being a like accomplished
character.<a name="FNanchor_354_360" id="FNanchor_354_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_360" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span> of his pieces are written upon the same subjects

indeed, to have had the literary credit and moral welfare of his
countrymen so much at stake that, I confess, I have a vast fondness
for his lucubrations. His "<i>English Gentlewoman</i>" might be reprinted
with advantage.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_354_360" id="Footnote_354_360"></a><a href="#FNanchor_354_360">[354]</a> The talents of <span class="smcap">Richard Braithwait</span> do not
appear to me to be so generally known and highly commended
as they merit to be. His <i>Nursery for Gentry</i>, 1651, 4to.
(with his portrait in an engraved frontispiece by Marshall),
is written with the author's usual point and spirit; but, as
I humbly conceive, is a less interesting performance than
his <i>English Gentleman</i>, 1633, 4to. (with a frontispiece by
Marshall), or <i>English Gentlewoman</i>, 1631, 4to. (also with a
frontispiece by the same artist). There is a terseness and
vigour in Braithwait's style which is superior to that of
his contemporary, Peacham; who seems to excel in a calm,
easy, and graceful manner of composition. Both these eminent
writers are distinguished for their scholastic and
gentlemanly attainments; but in the "divine art of poesy"
(in which light I mean here more particularly to display the
powers of Braithwait) Peacham has no chance of being
considered even as a respectable competitor with his
contemporary. Mr. George Ellis, in his pleasing <i>Specimens
of the early English Poets</i>, vol. iii., p. 103, has selected
two songs of Braithwait "from a work not enumerated by
Wood;" calling the author, "a noted wit and poet." His fame,
however, is not likely to "gather strength" from these
effusions. It is from some passages in <i>The Arcadian
Princesse</i>&mdash;a work which has been already, and more than
once, referred to, but which is too dislocated and
heterogeneous to recommend to a complete perusal&mdash;it is from
some passages in <i>this</i> work that I think Braithwait shines
with more lustre as a poet than in any to which his name is
affixed. Take the following miscellaneous ones, by way of
specimens. They are sometimes a little faulty in rhyme and
melody: but they are never lame from imbecility.</p>

<p>But it is time to pause upon Braithwait. Whoever does not
see, in these specimens, some of the most powerful rhyming

<p class="tbp">As I am permitted to be desultory in my remarks, (and, indeed, I
craved this permission at the outset of them) I may here notice the
publication of an excellent <i>Catalogue of Books</i>, in 1658, 4to.;
which, like its predecessor, Maunsell's, helped to inflame the
passions of purchasers, and to fill the coffers of booksellers.
Whenever you can meet with this small volume, purchase it, Lisardo; if
it be only for the sake of reading the spirited introduction prefixed
to it.<a name="FNanchor_355_361" id="FNanchor_355_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_361" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> The author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span> was a man, whoever he may chance to be, of no

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_355_361" id="Footnote_355_361"></a><a href="#FNanchor_355_361">[355]</a> This volume, which has been rather fully
described by me in the edition of More's <i>Utopia</i>, vol. ii.,
p. 260, 284&mdash;where some specimens of the "Introduction," so
strongly recommended by Lysander, will be found&mdash;is also
noticed in the <i>Athenæum</i>, vol. ii., 601; where there is an
excellent analysis of its contents. Here, let me subjoin
only one short specimen: In praise of learning, it is said:
"Wise and learned men are the surest stakes in the hedge of
a nation or city: they are the best conservators of our
liberties: the hinges on which the welfare, peace, and
happiness, hang; the best public good, and only
commonwealth's men. These lucubrations, meeting with a true
and brave mind, can conquer men; and, with the basilisk,
kill envy with a look." Sign. E. 4. rect.</p>

<p class="tbp">Where sleep now the relics of <span class="smcap">Dyson's</span> Library, which supplied that
<i>Helluo Librorum</i>, Richard Smith, with "most of his rarities?"<a name="FNanchor_356_362" id="FNanchor_356_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_362" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> I
would give something pretty considerable to have a correct list&mdash;but
more to have an unmolested sight&mdash;of this library, in its original
state: if it were merely to be convinced whether or not it contained a
copy of the <i>first edition of Shakespeare</i>, of larger dimensions, and
in cleaner condition, than the one in <span class="smcap">Philander's</span> Collection!</p>

strange, prying, and inquisitive genius, in the matter of
books, as may appear from many libraries; there being books,
chiefly in old English, almost in every library, that have
belonged to him, with his name upon them." <i>Peter Langtoft's
Chronicles</i>, vol. i., p. xiii. This intelligence Hearne
gleaned from his friend Mr. T. Baker. We are referred by the
former to the <i>Bibl. R. Smith</i>, p. 371, alias 401, N<span class="super">o</span>.

"collecting most of his rarities out of the library of H.

touching the state ecclesiastical as temporal of the realm
of England, which were published upon several occasions, in
the reigns of K. Henry the viith and viiith, Philip and

Mr. H. Dyson: out of whose library was gathered, by Mr.
Smith, a great part of the rarities of this catalogue." A
catalogue of the books sold in the reign of Hen. VII. would
be invaluable to a bibliographer! Let me add, for the sake
of pleasing, or rather, perhaps, tantalising my good friend
Mr. Haleswood, that this article is immediately under one
which describes "<i>An Ancient MS. of Hunting</i>, <span class="smcap">in vellum</span>

book of Devotion!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_357_363" id="Footnote_357_363"></a><a href="#FNanchor_357_363">[357]</a> From the address To the Reader, prefixed to
the Catalogue of <span class="smcap">Richard Smith's</span> books, which was put forth
by Chiswel the bookseller, in May 1682, 4to.&mdash;the
bibliomaniac is presented with the following interesting but
cramply written, particulars relating to the owner of them:
"Though it be needless to recommend what to all intelligent
persons sufficiently commend itself, yet, perhaps, it may
not be unacceptable to the ingenious to have some short
account concerning <i>This so much celebrated, so often
desired, so long expected, Library</i>, now exposed to sale.
The gentleman that collected it was a person infinitely
curious and inquisitive after books; and who suffered
nothing considerable to escape him, that fell within the
compass of his learning; for he had not the vanity of
desiring to be master of more than he knew how to use. He
lived to a very great age, and spent a good part of it
almost entirely in the search of books. Being as constantly
known every day to walk his rounds through the shops as he
sat down to meals, where his great skill and experience
enabled him to make choice of what was not obvious to every
vulgar eye. He lived in times which ministered peculiar
opportunities of meeting with books that are not every day
brought into publick light; and few eminent libraries were
bought where he had not the liberty to pick and choose. And
while others were forming arms, and new-modelling kingdoms,
<i>his</i> great ambition was to become master of a good <span class="smcap">Book</span>.
Hence arose, as that vast number of his books, so the
choiceness and rarity of the greatest part of them; and that
of all kinds, and in all sorts of learning," &amp;c. "Nor was
the owner of them a meer idle possessor of so great a
treasure: for as he generally <i>collated</i> his books upon the
buying of them (upon which account the buyer may rest pretty
secure of their being perfect) so he did not barely turn
over the leaves, but observed the defects of impressions,
and the ill arts used by many; compared the differences of
editions; concerning which, and the like cases, he has
entered memorable, and very useful, remarks upon very many
of the books under his own hand: Observations wherein,
certainly, never man was more diligent and industrious. Thus
much was thought fit to be communicated to publick notice,
by a gentleman who was intimately acquainted both with Mr.
Smith and his books. <i>This excellent library will be exposed
by auction, and the sale will begin on Monday the 15th day
of May next, at the auction house, known by the name of</i> <span class="smcap">the
swan</span>, <i>in Great St. Bartholomew's Close, and there continue,
day by day, the five first days of every week, till all the
books be sold.</i>" In this catalogue of Richard Smith's books,
the sharp-eyed bibliomaniac will discover twelve volumes
printed by <span class="smcap">Caxton</span>; which collectively, produced only the sum
of 3<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> The price of each of these volumes has
been already given to the public (<i>Typog. Antiq.</i>, vol i.,
p. cxxxii.) I suppose a thousand guineas would <i>now</i> barely
secure perfect copies of them! The catalogue itself is most
barbarously printed, and the arrangement and description of
the volumes such as to damn the compiler "to everlasting
fame." A number of the most curious, rare, and intrinsically
valuable books&mdash;the very insertion of which in a
bookseller's catalogue would probably now make a hundred
bibliomaniacs start from their homes by star-light, in order
to come in for the <i>first pickings</i>&mdash;a number of volumes of
this description are huddled together in one lot, and all
these classed under the provoking running title of "<i>Bundles
of Books</i>," or "<i>Bundles of sticht Books</i>!" But it is time
to bid adieu to this matchless collection. Leaving the
virtuoso "to toil, from rise to set of sun" after W.
Sherwin's "extra rare and fine" portrait of the collector,
which will cost him hard upon ten pounds (see <i>Sir William
Musgrave's Catalogue of English Portraits</i>, p. 92, n<span class="super">o</span>.
82), and to seize, if it be in his power, a copy of the
catalogue itself, "with the prices and purchasers' names"
(vide <i>Bibl. Lort.</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 1354). I proceed to attend upon
Lysander: not, however, without informing him that Strype
(<i>Life of Cranmer</i>, p. 368), as well as Hearne (<i>Liber Niger
Scaccarii</i>, vol. ii., p. 542), has condescended to notice
the famous library of this famous collector of books,
<span class="smcap">Richard Smith</span>!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> In truth I should have done even more than what your barren
imagination has here depicted. Smith's figure, his address, his
conversation, his library&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> Enough&mdash;peace! There is no end to Lisardo's <i>fruitful</i>
imagination. We are surfeited with the richness of it. Go on, dear
Lysander; but first, satisfy a desire which I just now feel to be
informed of the period when <i>Sales of Books, by Auction</i>, were
introduced into this country.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You take <i>that</i> for granted which
remains <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: missing 'to' in original">be</span> <i>proved</i>: namely, my ability to gratify
you in this particular. Of the precise period when this memorable
revolution in the sale of books took place I have no means of being
accurately informed: but I should think not anterior to the year 1673,
or 1674; for, in the year 1676, to the best of my recollection, the
catalogue of the Library of Dr. <span class="smcap">Seaman</span> was put forth; to which is
prefixed an address to the reader, wherein the custom of selling books
by auction is mentioned as having been but of recent origin in our
country.<a name="FNanchor_358_364" id="FNanchor_358_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_364" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> It was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span> no sooner introduced than it caught
the attention, and pleased the palates, of bibliomaniacs exceedingly:
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span> Clavel, a bookseller, who published useful catalogues of books to
be sold in his own warehouse, retorted in sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span> terms upon the folly
and extravagance which were exhibited at book auctions. However,
neither Clavel nor his successors, from that period to the present,
have been able to set this custom aside, nor to cool the fury of
book-auction bibliomaniacs&mdash;who, to their eternal shame be it said,
will sometimes, from the hot and hasty passions which are stirred up
by the poisonous miasmata floating in the auction-room, give a sum
twice or thrice beyond the real value of the books bidden for! Indeed,
I am frequently amused to see the vehemence and rapture with which a
dirty little volume is contended for and embraced&mdash;while a respectable
bookseller, like <span class="smcap">Portius</span>, coolly observes across the table&mdash;"I have a
better copy on sale at one third of the price!"</p>

<p class="letter">"It hath not been usual here in England to make <i>Sale of
Books by way of Auction or who will give most for them</i>: But
it having been practised in other countreys to the advantage
both of buyers and sellers, it was therefore conceived (for
the encouragement of learning) to publish the sale of these
books this manner of way; and it is hoped that this will not
be unacceptable to schollers: and therefore, methought it
convenient to give an advertisement concerning the manner of
proceeding therein. <i>First</i>, That having this catalogue of
the books, and their editions, under their several heads and
numbers, it will be more easie for any person of quality,
gentleman, or others, to depute any one to buy such books
for them as they shall desire, if their occasions will not
permit them to be present at the auction themselves." The
<i>second</i> clause is the usual one about <i>differences</i>
arising. The <i>third</i>, about discovering the imperfections of
the copies before they are taken away. The <i>fourth</i>, that
the buyers are to pay for their purchases within one month
after the termination of the auction. The <i>fifth</i>, that the
sale is to begin "punctually at 9 o'clock in the morning,
and two in the afternoon; and this to continue daily until
all the books be sold; wherefore it is desired that the
gentlemen, or those deputed by them, may be there precisely
at the hours appointed, lest they should miss the
opportunity of buying those books which either themselves or
their friends desire." As this is the earliest auction
catalogue which I have chanced to meet with, the <i>present</i>
reader may probably be pleased with the following specimens,
selected almost at random of the prices which were given for
books at a public sale, in the year 1676.</p>

<p>To continue the <i>History of Book Auctions</i>, a little
further. Two years after the preceding sale, namely, in
1678, were sold the collections of Dr. <span class="smcap">Manton</span>, Dr. <span class="smcap">Worsley</span>,
and others. In the address to the Reader, prefixed to
Manton's catalogue, it would seem that this was the
"<i>fourth</i> triall" of this mode of sale in our own country.
The conditions and time of sale the same as the preceding;
and because one Briggs, and not one Cooper, drew up the
same, Cooper craves the reader's "excuse for the mistakes
that have happened; and desires that the saddle may be laid
upon the right horse." In this collection there is a more
plentiful sprinkling of English books; among which,
Dugdale's Warwickshire, 1656, was sold for 1<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i>; and
Fuller's Worthies for the same sum. The "Collections of
Pamphlets, bound together in Quarto," were immense. Dr.
Worsley's collection, with two others, was sold two months
afterwards; namely, in May, 1678: and from the address "To
the Reader," it would appear that Dr. Manton's books brought
such high prices as to excite the envy of the trade.
Worsley's collection was sold at 9 and 2, the usual hours
"at the house over against the hen and chickens, in
Pater-Noster Row." The venders thus justify themselves at
the close of their address: "We have only this to add in
behalf of ourselves; that, forasmuch as a report has been
spread that we intend to use indirect means to advance the
prices, we do affirm that it is a groundless and malicious
suggestion of some of our own trade, envious of our
undertaking: and that, to avoid all manner of suspicion of
such practice, we have absolutely refused all manner of
commissions that have been offered us for buying (some of
them without limitation): and do declare that the company
shall have nothing but candid and ingenuous dealing from</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">John Dunmore.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Richard Chiswel.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>At this sale, the Shakspeare of 1632 brought 16<i>s.</i>; and of
1663, 1<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i>
</p><p>
In the November and December of the same year were sold by
auction the books of <span class="smcap">Voet</span>, <span class="smcap">Sangar</span>, and others, and from the
preface to each catalogue it would seem that the sale of
books by auction was then but a recent, yet a very
successful, experiment; and that even collections from
abroad were imported, in order to be disposed of in a like
manner.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> From what you say, it would appear to be wiser to lay out one's
money at a bookseller's than at a book-auction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Both methods must of necessity be resorted to: for you cannot
find with the one what you may obtain at the other. A distinguished
collector, such as the late Mr. Reed, or Mr. Gough, or Mr. Joseph
Windham, dies, and leaves his library to be sold by auction for the
benefit of his survivors. Now, in this library so bequeathed, you have
the fruits of book-labour, collected for a long period, and cultivated
in almost every department of literature. A thousand radii are
concentrated in such a circle; for it has, probably, been the object
of the collector's life to gather and to concentrate these radii. In
this case, therefore, you must attend the auction; you must see how
such a treasure is scattered, like the Sibylline leaves, by the winds
of fate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span> You must catch at what you want, and for what you have been
a dozen years, perhaps, in the pursuit of. You will pay dearly for
these favourite volumes; but you have them, and that is comfort
enough; and you exclaim, as a consolation amidst all the agony and
waste of time which such a contest may have cost you,&mdash;"Where, at what
bookseller's, are such gems now to be procured?" All this may be well
enough. But if I were again to have, as I have already had, the power
of directing the taste and applying the wealth of a young
collector&mdash;who, on coming of age, wisely considers books of at least
as much consequence as a stud of horses&mdash;I would say, go to Mr. Payne,
or Mr. Evans, or Mr. Mackinlay, or Mr. Lunn, for your Greek and Latin
Classics; to Mr. Dulau, or Mr. Deboffe, for your French; to Mr.
Carpenter, or Mr. Cuthell, for your English; and to Mr. White for your
Botany and rare and curious books of almost every description. Or, if
you want delicious copies, in lovely binding, of works of a sumptuous
character, go and drink coffee with Mr. Miller, of Albemarle
Street&mdash;under the warm light of an Argand lamp&mdash;amidst a blaze of
morocco and russia coating, which brings to your recollection the view
of the Temple of the Sun in the play of Pizarro! You will also find,
in the vender of these volumes, courteous treatment and "gentlemanly
notions of men and things." Again, if you wish to speculate deeply in
books, or to stock a newly-discovered province with what is most
excellent and popular in our own language, hire a vessel of 300 tons'
burthen, and make a contract with Messrs. Longman, Hurst, and Co., who
are enabled, from their store of <i>quires</i>, which measure 50 feet in
height, by 40 in length, and 20 in width, to satisfy all the wants of
the most craving bibliomaniacs. In opposition to this pyramid, enter
the closet of Mr. Triphook, jun., of St. James's Street&mdash;and resist,
if it be in your power to resist, the purchase of those clean copies,
so prettily bound, of some of our rarest pieces of black-letter
renown!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> From this digression, oblige us now by returning to our
bibliomaniacal history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Most willingly. But I am very glad you have given me an
opportunity of speaking, as I ought to speak, of some of our most
respectable booksellers, who are an ornament to the cause of <span class="smcap">the
bibliomania</span>.</p>

<p class="bp">We left off, I think, with noticing that renowned book-collector,
Richard Smith. Let me next make honourable mention of a "<i>par nobile
fratrum</i>" that ycleped are <span class="smcap">North</span>. The "Lives" of these men, with an
"Examen" (of "Kennet's History of England"), were published by a
relative (I think a grandson) of the same name; and two very amusing
and valuable quarto volumes they are! From one of these Lives, we
learn how pleasantly the <span class="smcap">Lord Keeper</span> used to make his meals upon some
one entertaining Law-volume or another: how he would breakfast upon
<i>Stamford</i>,<a name="FNanchor_359_365" id="FNanchor_359_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_365" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> dine upon <i>Coke</i>, and sup upon <i>Fitzherbert</i>, &amp;c.;
and, in truth, a most insatiable book appetite did this eminent judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
possess. For, not satisfied ("and no marvel, I trow") with the
foregoing lean fare, he would oftentimes regale himself with a
well-served-up course of the <i>Arts</i>, <i>Sciences</i>, and the
<i>Belles-Lettres</i>!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_359_365" id="Footnote_359_365"></a><a href="#FNanchor_359_365">[359]</a> These are the words of <span class="smcap">Lord Keeper North's</span>
Biographer: "There are of Law-Books, institutions of various
sorts, and reports of cases (now) almost innumerable. The
latter bear most the controversial law, and are read as
authority such as may be quoted: and I may say the gross of
law lecture lies in them. But to spend weeks and months
wholly in them, is like horses in a string before a loaden
waggon. They are indeed a careful sort of reading, and
chiefly require common-placing, and that makes the work go
on slowly. His <span class="smcap">Lordship</span> therefore used to mix some
institutionary reading with them, as after a fulness of the
reports in a morning, about noon, to take a repast in
<i>Stamford</i>, <i>Compton</i>, or the Lord <i>Coke's</i> Pleas of the
Crown and Jurisdiction of Courts, <i>Manwood</i> of the Forest
Law, <i>Fitzherbert's</i> Natura Brevium; and also to look over
some of the Antiquarian Books, as <i>Britton</i>, <i>Bracton</i>,
<i>Fleta</i>, <i>Fortescue</i>, <i>Hengham</i>, <i>the old Tenures
Narrationes Novæ</i>, the old <i>Natura Brevium</i>, and the
Diversity of Courts. These, at times, for change and
refreshment, being books all fit to be known. And those
that, as to authority, are obsoleted, go rounder off-hand,
because they require little common-placing, and that only as
to matter very singular and remarkable, and such as the
student fancies he shall desire afterwards to recover. And,
besides all this, the day afforded him room for a little
History, especially of England, modern books, and
Controversy in Print, &amp;c. In this manner he ordered his own
studies, but with excursions into <i>Humanity</i> and <i>Arts</i>,
beyond what may be suitable to the genius of every young
student in the law." <i>Life of Lord Keeper Guildford</i>, pp.
18, 19. <i>North's Lives</i>, edit. 1754, 4to.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">His brother, Dr. <span class="smcap">John North</span>, was a still greater <i>Helluo Librorum</i>;
"his soul being never so staked down as in an old bookseller's shop."
Not content with a superficial survey of whatever he inspected, he
seems to have been as intimately acquainted with all the book-selling
fraternity of <i>Little-Britain</i> as was his contemporary, Richard Smith;
and to have entered into a conspiracy with <span class="smcap">Robert Scott</span><a name="FNanchor_360_366" id="FNanchor_360_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_366" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>&mdash;the most
renowned book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span> vender in this country, if not in Europe&mdash;to deprive
all bibliomaniacs of a chance of procuring rare and curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span> volumes,
by sweeping every thing that came to market, in the shape of a book,
into their own curiously-wrought and widely-spread nets. Nay, even
Scott himself was sometimes bereft of all power, by means of the
potent talisman which this learned Doctor exercised&mdash;for the latter,
"at one lift," would now and then sweep a whole range of shelves in
Scott's shop of every volume which it contained. And yet how
whimsical, and, in my humble opinion, ill-founded, was Dr. North's
taste in matters of typography! Would you believe it, Lisardo, he
preferred the meagre classical volumes, printed by the <i>Gryphii</i>, in
the italic letter, to the delicate and eye-soothing lustre of the
<i>Elzevir</i> type&mdash;?</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_360_366" id="Footnote_360_366"></a><a href="#FNanchor_360_366">[360]</a> "Now he began to look after books, and to lay
the foundation of a competent library. He dealt with Mr.
<span class="smcap">Robert Scott</span>, of <i>Little-Britain</i>, whose sister was his
grandmother's woman; and, upon that acquaintance he
expected, and really had from him, useful information of
books and their editions. This Mr. Scott was, in his time,
the greatest librarian in Europe; for, besides his stock in
England, he had warehouses in Francfort, Paris, and other
places, and dealt by factors. After he was grown old, and
much worn by multiplicity of business, he began to think of
his ease and to leave off. Whereupon he contracted with one
Mills, of St. Paul's Church-yard, near £10,000 deep, and
articled not to open his shop any more. But Mills, with his
auctioneering, Atlasses, and projects, failed, whereby poor
Scott lost above half his means: but he held to his contract
of not opening his shop, and when he was in London (for he
had a country house), passed most of his time at his house
amongst the rest of his books; and his reading (for he was
no mean scholar) was the chief entertainment of his time. He
was not only an expert bookseller, but a very conscientious
good man; and when he threw up his trade, Europe had no
small loss of him. Our Doctor, at one lift, bought of him a
whole set of Greek Classics in folio, of the best editions.
This sunk his stock at that time; but afterwards, for many
years of his life, all that he could (as they say) rap or
run, went the same way. But the progress was small; for such
a library as he desired, compared with what the pittance of
his stock would purchase, allowing many years to the
gathering, was of desperate expectation. He was early
sensible of a great disadvantage to him in his studies, by
the not having a good library in his reach; and he used to
say that a man could not be a scholar at the second-hand:
meaning, that learning is to be had from the original
authors, and not from any quotations, or accounts in other
books, for men gather with divers views, and, according to
their several capacities, often perfunctorily, and almost
always imperfectly: and through such slight reading, a
student may know somewhat, but not judge of either author or
subject. He used to say <i>an old author could not be
unprofitable</i>; for although in their proper time they had
little or no esteem, yet, in after times, they served to
interpret words, customs, and other matters, found obscure
in other books; of which A. Gellius is an apt instance. He
courted, as a fond lover, all <i>best editions, fairest
character, best bound and preserved</i>. If the subject was in
his favour (as the Classics) he cared not how many of them
he had, even of the same edition, if he thought it among the
best, either <i>better bound</i>, <i>squarer cut</i>, <i>neater covers</i>,
or some such qualification caught him. He delighted in the
small editions of the Classics, by Seb. Gryphius; and divers
of his acquaintance, meeting with any of them, bought and
brought them to him, which he accepted as choice presents,
although perhaps he had one or two of them before. He said
that the <i>black italic</i> character agreed with his eye sight
(which he accounted but weak) better than any other print,
the old Elzevir not excepted, whereof the characters seemed
to him more blind and confused than those of the other.
Continual use gives men a judgment of things comparatively,
and they come to fix on that as most proper and easy which
no man, upon cursory view, would determine. <i>His soul was
never so staked down as in an old bookseller's shop</i>; for
having (as the statutes of the college required) taken
orders, he was restless till he had compassed some of that
sort of furniture as he thought necessary for his
profession. He was, for the most part, his own factor, and
seldom or never bought by commission; which made him lose
time in turning over vast numbers of books, and he was very
hardly pleased at last. I have borne him company at shops
for hours together, and, minding him of the time, he hath
made a dozen proffers before he would quit. By this care and
industry, at length, he made himself master of a very
considerable library, wherein the choicest collection was
<i>Greek</i>." There is some smartness in the foregoing
observations. The following, in a strain of equal interest,
affords a lively picture of the <i>bookselling trade</i> at the
close of the 17th century: "It may not be amiss to step a
little aside, to reflect on the vast change in the trade of
books, between that time and ours. Then, <i>Little-Britain</i>
was a plentiful and perpetual emporium of learned authors;
and men went thither as to a market. This drew to the place
a mighty trade; the rather because the shops were spacious,
and the learned gladly resorted to them, where they seldom
failed to meet with agreeable conversation. And the
booksellers themselves were knowing and conversible men,
with whom, for the sake of bookish knowledge, the greatest
wits were pleased to converse. And we may judge the time as
well spent there, as (in latter days) either in tavern or
coffee-house: though the latter hath carried off the spare
hours of most people. But now this emporium is vanished, and
trade contracted into the hands of two or three persons,
who, to make good their monopoly, ransack, not only their
neighbours of the trade that are scattered about town, but
all over England, aye, and beyond sea too, and send abroad
their circulators, and, in that manner, get into their hands
all that is valuable. The rest of the trade are content to
take their refuse, with which, and the fresh scum of the
press, they furnish one side of a shop, which serves for the
sign of a bookseller, rather than a real one; but, instead
of selling, dealing as factors, and procure what the country
divines and gentry send for; of whom each hath his book
factor, and, when wanting any thing, writes to his
bookseller, and pays his bill. And it is wretched to
consider what pickpocket work, with help of the press, these
demi-booksellers make. They crack their brains to find out
selling subjects, and keep hirelings in garrets, at hard
meat, to write and correct by the great (qu. groat); and so
puff up an octavo to a sufficient thickness, and there's six
shillings current for an hour and a half's reading, and
perhaps never to be read or looked upon after. One that
would go higher must take his fortune at blank walls, and
corners of streets, or repair to the sign of Bateman, Innys,
and one or two more, where are best choice and better
pennyworth's. I might touch other abuses, as bad paper,
incorrect printing, and false advertising; all which, and
worse, is to be expected, if a careful author is not at the
heels of them." Life of the Hon. and Rev. Dr. John North.
<i>North's Lives</i>, edit. 1744, 4to., p. 240, &amp;c. At page 244,
there is a curious account of the doctor's amusing himself
with keeping spiders in a glass case&mdash;feeding them with

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_361_367" id="Footnote_361_367"></a><a href="#FNanchor_361_367">[361]</a> The name and literary labours of <span class="smcap">Anthony Wood</span>
are now held in general, and deservedly high, respect: and
it is somewhat amusing, though not a little degrading to
human nature, to reflect upon the celebrity of that man who,
when living, seems to have been ridiculed by the proud and
flippant, and hated by the ignorant and prejudiced, part of
his academical associates. The eccentricities of Wood were
considered heretical; and his whims were stigmatized as
vices. The common herd of observers was unable to discover,
beneath his strange garb, and coarse exterior, all that
acuteness of observation, and retentiveness of memory, as
well as inflexible integrity, which marked the intellectual
character of this wonderful man. But there is no necessity
to detain and tantalize the reader by this formal train of
reasoning, when a few leading features of Wood's person,
manners, and habits of study, &amp;c., have been thus pleasingly
described to us by Hearne, in the life of him prefixed to
the genuine edition of the <i>History and Antiquities (or
Annals) of the University of Oxford</i>. "He was equally
regardless of envy or fame, out of his great love to truth,
and therefore 'twas no wonder he took such a liberty of
speech, as most other authors, out of prudence, cunning, or
design, have usually declined. And indeed, as to his
language, he used such words as were suitable to his
profession. It is impossible to think that men, who always
converse with old authors, should not learn the dialect of
their acquaintance&mdash;an antiquary retains an old word, with
as much religion as an old relick. And further, since our
author was ignorant of the rules of conversation, it is no
wonder he uses so many severe reflections, and adds so many
minute passages of men's lives. I have been told that it was
usual with him, for the most part, to rise about four
o'clock in the morning, and to eat hardly any thing till
night; when, after supper, he would go into some by-alehouse
in town, or else to one in some village near, and there by
himself take his <i>pipe and pot</i>," &amp;c. "But so it is that,
notwithstanding our author's great merits, he was but little
regarded in the University, being observed to be more
clownish than courteous, and always to go in an old
antiquated dress. Indeed he was a mere scholar, and
consequently must expect, from the greatest number of men,
disrespect; but this notwithstanding, he was always a true
lover of his mother, the University, and did more for her
than others care to do that have received so liberally from
her towards their maintenance, and have had greater
advantages of doing good than he had. Yea, his affection was
not at all alienated, notwithstanding his being so hardly
dealt with as to be expelled; which would have broken the
hearts of some. But our author was of a most noble spirit,
and little regarded whatever afflictions he lay under,
whilst he was conscious to himself of doing nothing but what
he could answer. At length after he had, by continual
drudging, worn out his body, he left this world contentedly,
by a stoppage of his urine, anno domini 1695, and was buried
in the east corner of the north side of St. John's Church,
adjoyning to Merton College, and in the wall is a small
monument fixed, with these words:</p>

<p class="center">
H.S.E.<br />
<span class="smcap">antonius wood, antiquarius</span>.<br />
<i>ob. 28 Nov.</i> <span class="smcap">Ao.</span> 1695, æt. 64."<br />
</p>

<p>In his person, he was of a large robust make, tall and thin,
and had a sedate and thoughtful look, almost bordering upon
a melancholy cast. Mr. Hearne says, in his <i>Collectanea
MSS.</i>, that though he was but sixty-four years of age when
he died, he appeared to be above fourscore; that he used
spectacles long before he had occasion for them, that he
stooped much when he walked, and generally carried his stick
under his arm, seldom holding it in his hand. As to the
manner of his life, it was solitary and ascetic. The
character which Gassendus gives of Peireskius, may, with
propriety, be used as descriptive of Mr. Wood's. "As to the
care of his person, cleanliness was his chief object, he
desiring no superfluity or costliness, either in his habit
or food. His house was furnished in the same manner as his
table; and as to the ornament of his private apartment, he
was quite indifferent. Instead of hangings, his chamber was
furnished with the prints of his particular friends, and
other men of note, with vast numbers of commentaries,
transcripts, letters, and papers of various kinds. His bed
was of the most ordinary sort; his table loaded with papers,
schedules, and other things, as was also every chair in the
room. He was a man of strict sobriety, and by no means
delicate in the choice of what he eat. Always restrained by
temperance, he never permitted the sweet allurements of
luxury to overcome his prudence." Such, as is here
represented, was the disposition of Mr. <span class="smcap">Wood</span>: of so retired
a nature as seldom to desire or admit a companion at his
walks or meals; so that he is said to have dined alone in
his chamber for thirty years together. Mr. Hearne says that
it was his custom to "go to the booksellers at those hours
when the greater part of the University were at their
dinners," &amp;c. And at five leaves further, in a note, we find
that, "when he was consulting materials for his <i>Athenæ
Oxon.</i>, he would frequently go to the booksellers, and
generally give money to them, purposely to obtain titles of
books from them; and 'twas observed of him that he spared no
charges to make that work as compleat and perfect as
possible." <i>Hearne's Coll. MSS. in Bodl. Lib.</i>, vol. ix., p.
185. The following letter, describing Wood's last illness,
and the disposition of his literary property, is
sufficiently interesting to be here, in part, laid before
the reader: it was written by Mr. (afterwards Bishop) Tanner
to Dr. Charlett.
</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Honoured Master,</span></p>

<p class="letter">Yesterday, at dinner-time, Mr. Wood sent for me; when I
came, I found Mr. Martin and Mr. Bisse of Wadham (college)
with him, who had (with much ado) prevailed upon him to set
about looking over his papers, so to work we went, and
continued tumbling and separating some of his MSS. till it
was dark. We also worked upon him so far as to sign and
declare that sheet of paper, which he had drawn up the day
before, and called it <i>his will</i>; for fear he should not
live till night. He had a very bad night of it last night,
being much troubled with vomiting. This morning we three
were with him again, and Mr. Martin bringing with him the
form of a will, that had been drawn up by Judge Holloway, we
writ his will over again, as near as we could, in form of
law. He has given to the University, to be reposited in the
<i>Museum Ashmol.</i>, all his MSS., not only those of his own
collection, but also all others which he has in his
possession, except some few of Dr. Langbain's Miscellanea,
which he is willing should go to the public library. He has
also given all his printed books and pamphlets to the said
musæum which are not there already. This benefaction will
not, perhaps, be so much valued by the University as it
ought to be, because it comes from Anthony Wood; but truly
it is a most noble gift, his collection of MSS. being
invaluable, and his printed books, most of them, not to be
found in town," &amp;c. This letter is followed by other
accounts yet more minute and touching, of the last mortal
moments of poor old Anthony! It now remains to say a few
words about his literary labours. A short history of the
editions of the <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i> (vide <a href="#Page_45">p. 45</a>, ante) has
already been communicated to the reader. We may here observe
that his <i>Antiquities of the University</i> shared a similar
fate; being garbled in a Latin translation of them, which
was put forth under the auspices of Bishop Fell: 1676, fol.,
in 2 vols. Wood's own MS. was written in the English
language, and lay neglected till towards the end of the 18th
century, when the Rev. Mr. Gutch conferred a real benefit
upon all the dutiful sons of <span class="smcap">alma mater</span>, by publishing the
legitimate text of their venerable and upright historian;
under the title of <i>The History and Antiquities of the
Colleges and Halls</i>, 1786, 4to., with a supplemental volume
by way of <i>Appendix</i>, 1790, 4to., containing copious indexes to
the two. Then followed the Annals of the University at large, viz. <i>The
History and Antiquities of the University
of Oxford</i>; 1792, 4to., in two volumes; the latter being
divided into <i>two</i> parts, or volumes, with copious indexes.
These works, which are now getting scarce, should be in
every philological, as well as topographical, collection. In
order to compensate the reader for the trouble of wading
through the preceding tremendous note, I here
present him with a wood-cut facsimile of a copper-plate print of Wood's portrait, which is prefixed to his Life, 1772, 8vo. If he
wishes for more curious particulars respecting Wood's
literary labours, let him take a peep into <i>Thomæ Caii
Vindic. Antiq. Acad. Oxon.</i>: 1730, 8vo., vol. i., pp. xl.
xliii. <i>Edit. Hearne.</i> Wood's study, in the Ashmolean
museum, is yet to be seen. It is filled with curious books,
which, however, have not hitherto been catalogued with
accuracy. Ritson has availed himself, more successfully than
any antiquary in poetry, of the book treasures in this
museum.</p>

is curious on many accounts; and I do heartily wish that
foppish and tasteless collectors would give it a very
serious perusal. At the same time, all collectors possessed
of common sense and liberal sentiment will be pleased to see
their own portraits so faithfully drawn therein. It is taken
from the prefatory address,
</p>

<p class="center">"TO THE READER.</p>

<p>The character of the person whose collection this was, is so
well known, that there is no occasion to say much of him,
nor to any man of judgment that inspects the catalogue of
the collection itself. Something, however, it becomes us to
say of both; and this I think may with truth and modesty
enough be said, that as few men knew books, and that part of
learning which is called <i>Historia Litteraria</i>, better than
himself, so there never yet appeared in England so choice
and valuable a catalogue to be thus disposed of as this
before us: more especially of that sort of books which are
out of the common course, which a man may make the business
of his life to collect, and at last not to be able to
accomplish. A considerable part of them being so little
known, even to many of the learned buyers, that we have
reason to apprehend this misfortune to attend the sale, that
there will not be competitors enough to raise them up to
their just and real value. Certain it is this library
contains not a few which never appeared in any auction here
before; nor indeed, as I have heard him say, for ought he
knew, (and he knew as well as any man living) <i>in any
printed catalogue in the world</i>."&mdash;"We must confess that,
being a person who collected his books for use, and not for
ostentation or ornament, he seemed no more solicitous about
<i>their</i> dress than <i>his own</i>; and therefore you'll find that
a <i>gilt back</i>, or a <i>large margin</i>, was very seldom any
inducement to him to buy. 'Twas sufficient that he had the
book." "Though considering that he was so unhappy as to want
heirs capable of making that use of them which he had done,
and that therefore they were to be dispersed after this
manner; I have heard him condemn his own negligence in that
particular; observing, that the garniture of a book was as
apt to recommend it to a great part of our <i>modern
collectors</i> (whose learning goes not beyond the edition, the
title-page, and the printer's name) as the intrinsic value
could. But that he himself was not a mere nomenclator, and
versed only in title-pages, but had made that just and
laudable use of his books which would become all those that
set up for collectors, I appeal to the Literati of his
acquaintance, who conversed most frequently with him; how
full, how ready, and how exact he was in answering any
question that was proposed to him relating to learned men,
or their writings; making no secret of any thing that he
knew, or any thing that he had; being naturally one of the
most communicative men living, both of his knowledge and his
books."&mdash;"And give me leave to say this of him, upon my own
knowledge; that he never grudged his money in procuring, nor
his time or labour in perusing, any book which he thought
could be any ways instructive to him, and having the
felicity of a memory always faithful, always officious,
which never forsook him, though attacked by frequent and
severe sickness, and by the worst of diseases, old age, his
desire of knowledge attended him to the last; and he pursued
his studies with equal vigour and application to the very
extremity of his life." It remains to add a part of the
title of the catalogue of the collection of this
extraordinary <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: bibliomaniac">bibilomaniac</span>: "<i>A Catalogue of the Library of the late
learned</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Francis Bernard</span>, <i>Fellow of the College of
Physicians, and Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
&amp;c.</i>," 1698, 8vo. The English books are comprised in 1241
articles; and, among them, the keen investigator of ancient
catalogues will discover some prime rarities.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">Having at length reached the threshold, let us knock at the door, of
the eighteenth century. What gracious figures are those which approach
to salute us? They are the forms of <span class="smcap">Bishops Fell</span> and <span class="smcap">More</span>:<a name="FNanchor_363_369" id="FNanchor_363_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_369" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
prelates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span> distinguished for their never ceasing admiration of
valuable and curious works. The former is better known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span> as an editor;
the latter, as a collector&mdash;and a collector, too, of such multifarious
knowledge, of such vivid and just perceptions, and unabating
activity&mdash;that while he may be hailed as the <i>Father of</i> <span class="bl">black-letter</span>
<i>Collectors</i> in this country, he reminds us of his present successor
in the same see; who is not less enamoured of rare and magnificent
volumes, but of a different description, and whose library assumes a
grander cast of character.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_363_369" id="Footnote_363_369"></a><a href="#FNanchor_363_369">[363]</a> As I have already presented the public with
some brief account respecting <span class="smcap">Bishop Fell</span>, and sharpened the
appetites of Grangerites to procure rather a rare portrait
of the same prelate (See <i>Introd. to the Classics</i>, vol. i.,
89), it remains only to add, in the present place, that
Hearne, in his <i>Historia Vitæ et Regni Ricardi II.</i>, 1729,
8vo., p. 389, has given us a curious piece of information
concerning this eminent bibliomaniac, which may not be
generally known. His authority is Anthony Wood. From this
latter we learn that, when Anthony and the Bishop were
looking over the <i>History and Antiquities of the University
of Oxford</i>, to correct it for the press, Fell told Wood that
"<span class="smcap">Wicliffe</span> was a grand dissembler; a man of little
conscience; and what he did, as to religion, was more out of
vain glory, and to obtain unto him a name, than out of
honesty&mdash;or to that effect." Can such a declaration, from
such a character, be credited? <span class="smcap">Bishop More</span> has a stronger
claim on our attention and gratitude. Never has there
existed an episcopal bibliomaniac of such extraordinary
talent and fame in the walk of <i>Old English Literature</i>!&mdash;as
the reader shall presently learn. The bishop was admitted of
Clare Hall, Cambridge, in 1662. In 1691, he became Bishop of
Norwich; and was translated to Ely in 1707; but did not
survive the translation above seven years. How soon and how
ardently the passion for collecting books possessed him it
is out of my present power to make the reader acquainted.
But that More was in the zenith of his bibliomaniacal
reputation while he filled the see of Norwich is
unquestionable; for thus writes Strype: "The Right Reverend,
the Lord Bishop of Norwich, the possessor of a great and
curious collection of MSS. and other ancient printed pieces
(little inferior to MSS. in regard of their scarceness) hath
also been very considerably assistant to me as well in this
present work as in others;" &amp;c. Preface (sign. a 2) to <i>Life
of Aylmer</i>, 1701, 8vo. Burnet thus describes his fine
library when he was Bishop of Ely. "This noble record was
lent me by my reverend and learned brother, Dr. <span class="smcap">More</span>, Bishop
of Ely, who has gathered together a most valuable treasure,
both of printed books and manuscripts, beyond what one can
think that the life and labour of one man could have
compassed; and which he is as ready to communicate, as he
has been careful to collect it." <i>Hist. of the Reformation</i>,
vol. iii., p. 46. It seems hard to reconcile this testimony
of Burnet with the late Mr. Gough's declaration, that "The
bishop collected his library by plundering those of the
clergy in his diocese; some he paid with sermons or more
modern books; others only with '<i>quid illiterati cum
libris</i>.'" On the death of More, his library was offered to
Lord Oxford for 8000<i>l.</i>; and how that distinguished and
truly noble collector could have declined the purchase of
such exquisite treasures&mdash;unless his own shelves were
groaning beneath the weight of a great number of similar
volumes&mdash;is difficult to account for. But a public-spirited
character was not wanting to prevent the irreparable
dispersion of such book-gems: and that patriotic character
was <span class="smcap">George I.</span>!&mdash;who gave 6000<i>l.</i> for them, and presented
them to the public library of the University of  Cambridge!&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"These are imperial works, and worthy kings!"</p>

<p>And here, benevolent reader, the almost unrivalled
<i>Bibliotheca Moriana</i> yet quietly and securely reposes. Well
do I remember the congenial hours I spent (A.D. 1808) in the
<i>closet</i> holding the most precious part of Bishop More's
collection, with my friend the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, tutor of one
of the colleges in the same University, at my
right-hand&mdash;(himself "greatly given to the study of books")
actively engaged in promoting my views, and increasing my
extracts&mdash;but withal, eyeing me sharply "ever and anon"&mdash;and
entertaining a laudable distrust of a keen book-hunter from
a rival University! I thank my good genius that I returned,
as I entered, with clean hands! My love of truth and of
bibliography compels me to add, with a sorrowful heart, that
not only is there no printed catalogue of Bishop More's
books, but even the <span class="smcap">fine public library of the university</span>
remains unpublished in print! In this respect they really do
"order things better in France." Why does such indifference
to the cause of general learning exist&mdash;and in the 19th
century too? Let me here presume to submit a plan to the
consideration of the syndics of the press; provided they
should ever feel impressed with the necessity of informing
the literati, of other countries as well as our own, of the
book treasures contained in the libraries of Cambridge. It
is simply this. Let the books in the Public Library form the
substratum of the <i>Catalogue Raisonné</i> to be printed in
three or more quarto volumes. If, in any particular
department, there be valuable editions of a work which are
<i>not</i> in the public, but in another, library&mdash;ex. gr. in
Trinity, or St. John's&mdash;specify this edition in its
appropriate class; and add <i>Trin. Coll., &amp;c.</i>&mdash;If this copy
contain notes of Bentley, or Porson, add "<i>cum notis
Bentleii</i>," <i>&amp;c.</i>: so that such a catalogue would present,
not only <i>every</i> volume in the <i>Public Library</i>, but <i>every
valuable</i> edition of a work in the whole University. Nor is
the task so Herculean as may be thought. The tutors of the
respective colleges would, I am sure, be happy, as well as
able, to contribute their proportionate share of labour
towards the accomplishment of so desirable and invaluable a
work.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">The opening of the 18th century was also distinguished by the death of
a bibliomaniac of the very first order and celebrity. Of one, who had,
no doubt, frequently discoursed largely and eloquently with Luttrell,
(of whom presently) upon the rarity and value of certain editions of
old <i>Ballad Poetry</i>: and between whom presents of curious black-letter
volumes were, in all probability, frequently passing. I allude to the
famous <span class="smcap">Samuel Pepys</span>;<a name="FNanchor_364_370" id="FNanchor_364_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_370" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Secretary to the Admiralty.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_364_370" id="Footnote_364_370"></a><a href="#FNanchor_364_370">[364]</a> "<i>The Maitland Collection of Manuscripts</i> was
ever in the collector's (Sir Richard Maitland's)
family."&mdash;"His grandson was raised to the dignity of Earl of
Lauderdale." "The Duke of Lauderdale, a descendant of the
collector's grandson, presented the Maitland Collection,
along with other MSS., to <span class="smcap">Samuel Pepys</span>, Esq. Secretary of
the Admiralty to Charles II. and James II. Mr. Pepys was one
of the earliest collectors of rare books, &amp;c. in England;
and the duke had no taste for such matters; so either from
friendship, or some point of interest, he gave them to Mr.
Pepys,"&mdash;who "dying 26 May, 1703, in his 71st year, ordered,
by will, the <span class="smcap">Pepysian Library</span> at Magdalen College,
Cambridge, to be founded, in order to preserve his very
valuable collection entire. It is undoubtedly the most
curious in England, those of the British Museum excepted;
and is kept in excellent order." Mr. Pinkerton's preface, p.
vii., to <i>Ancient Scottish Poems from the Maitland
Collection, &amp;c.</i>, 1786, 8vo., 2 vols. I wish it were in my
power to add something concerning the parentage, birth,
education, and pursuits of the extraordinary collector of
this extraordinary collection; but no biographical work,
which I have yet consulted, vouchsafes even to mention his
name. His merits are cursorily noticed in the <i>Quarterly
Review</i>, vol. iv., p. 326-7. Through the medium of a friend,
I learn from Sir Lucas Pepys, Bart., that our illustrious
bibliomaniac, his great uncle, was President of the Royal
Society, and that his collection at Cambridge contains a
<i>Diary</i> of his life, written with his own hand. But it is
high time to speak of the black-letter gems contained in the
said collection. That the <span class="smcap">Pepysian collection</span> is at once
choice and valuable cannot be disputed; but that access to
the same is prompt and facile, is not quite so indisputable.
There is a MS. catalogue of the books, by Pepys himself,
with a small rough drawing of a view of the interior of the
library. The books are kept in their original (I think
walnut-wood) presses: and cannot be examined unless in the
presence of a fellow.&mdash;Such is the nice order to be
observed, according to the bequest, that every book must be
replaced where it was taken from; and the loss of a single
volume causes the collection to be confiscated, and
transported to Benet-college library. Oh, that there were
<i>an act of parliament</i> to regulate bequests of this
kind!&mdash;that the doors to knowledge might, by a greater
facility of entrance, be more frequently opened by students;
and that the medium between unqualified confidence and
unqualified suspicion might be marked out and followed. Are
these things symptomatic of an iron or a brazen age! But the
bibliomaniac is impatient for a glance at the 'forementioned
black-letter treasures!&mdash;Alas, I have promised more than I
can perform! Yet let him cast his eye upon the first volume
of the recent edition of <i>Evans' Collection of Old Ballads</i>
(see <i>in limine</i>, p. ix.) and look into the valuable notes
of <i>Mr. Todd's Illustrations of Gower and Chaucer</i>,&mdash;in
which latter, he will find no bad specimen of these
<i>Pepysian gems</i>, in the exultation of my friend, the author,
over another equally respected friend&mdash;in consequence of his
having discovered, among these treasures, a strange, merry,
and conceited work, entitled "<i>Old Meg of Herefordshire for
a Mayd-Marian; and Hereford Town for a Morris-daunce, &amp;c.</i>,"
1609, 4to., p. 273. <span class="smcap">Ex uno Disce omnes.</span> The left-handed
critic, or anti-black-letter reader, will put a wicked
construction upon the quotation of this motto in capital
letters: let him: he will repent of his folly in due time.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>Now it was a convincing proof to me, my dear friends, that the
indulgence of a <span class="smcap">passion for books</span> is perfectly compatible with any
situation, however active and arduous. For while this illustrious
bibliomaniac was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span> sending forth his messengers to sweep every
bookseller's shop from the Tweed to Penzance, for the discovery of old
and almost unknown ballads&mdash;and while his name rung in the ears of
rival collectors&mdash;he was sedulous, in his professional situation, to
put the <i>Navy of Old England</i> upon the most respectable footing; and
is called the <i>Father</i> of that system which, carried into effect by
British hearts of oak, has made the thunder of our cannon to be heard
and feared on the remotest shores. Nor is it a slight or common
coincidence that a spirit of book-collecting, which stimulated the
<i>Secretary</i> of the Admiralty at the opening of the 18th century,
should, at the close of it, have operated with equal or greater force
in a <i>First Lord</i> of the same glorious department of our
administration. But we shall speak more fully of this latter
character, and of his matchless collection, in a future stage of our
discussion.</p>

<p class="bp">While we are looking round us at this period, we may as well slightly
notice the foundation of the <i>Blenheim Library</i>. The <span class="smcap">Duke of
Marlborough</span><a name="FNanchor_365_371" id="FNanchor_365_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_371" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> was resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span> that no naval commander, or person
connected with the navy, should eclipse himself in the splendour of
book-collecting: but it was to <span class="smcap">Prince Eugene</span> that Marlborough was
indebted for his taste in this par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>ticular; or rather the English
commander was completely bitten with the bibliomaniacal disease in
consequence of seeing Eugene secure rare and magnificent copies of
works, when a city or town was taken: and the German Prince himself
expatiates upon the treasures of his library, with a rapture with
which none but the most thorough-bred bibliomaniacs can ever
adequately sympathise.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_365_371" id="Footnote_365_371"></a><a href="#FNanchor_365_371">[365]</a> The <span class="smcap">Library at Blenheim</span> is one of the
grandest rooms in Europe. The serpentine sheet of water,
which flows at some little distance, between high banks of
luxuriant and moss-woven grass, and is seen from the
interior, with an overhanging dark wood of oaks, is
sufficient to awaken the finest feelings that ever animated
the breast of a bibliomaniac. The books are select and
curious, as well as numerous; and although they may be
eclipsed, in both these particulars, by a few rival
collections, yet the following specimen is no despicable
proof of the ardour with which <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span>, the founder of
the Library, pushed forward his bibliomaniacal spirit. I am

<p>The present <span class="smcap">Marquis of Blandford</span> inherits, in no small
degree, the book-collecting spirit of his illustrious
ancestor. He is making collections in those departments of
literature in which the Blenheim Library is comparatively
deficient; and his success has already been such as to lead
us to hope for as perfect a display of volumes printed by
<i>Caxton</i> as there is of those executed by foreign printers.
The Marquis's collection of <i>Emblems</i> is, I believe, nearly
perfect: of these, there are a few elegantly printed
catalogues for private distribution. Lysander, above,
supposes that Marlborough caught the infection of the
<i>book-disease</i> from <span class="smcap">Prince Eugene</span>; and the supposition is,
perhaps, not very wide of the truth. The library of this
great German prince, which is yet entire, (having been
secured from the pillage of Gallic Vandalism, when a certain
emperor visited a certain city) is the proudest feature in
the public library at Vienna. The books are in very fine old
binding, and, generally of the largest dimensions. And,
indeed, old England has not a little to boast of (at least,
so bibliomaniacs must always think) that, from the recently
published <i>Memoirs of Eugene</i> (1811, 8vo., p. 185), it would
appear that the prince "bought his fine editions of books <span class="smcap">at
London</span>:"&mdash;he speaks also of his "excellent French, Latin,
and Italian works, well bound"&mdash;as if he enjoyed the
"arrangment" of <i>them</i>, as much as the contemplation of his
"cascades, large water-spouts, and superb basins." <i>Ibid.</i>
Whether Eugene himself was suddenly inflamed with the ardour
of buying books, from some lucky spoils in the pillaging of
towns&mdash;as Lysander supposes&mdash;is a point which may yet admit
of fair controversy. For my own part, I suspect the German
commander had been straying, in his early manhood, among the
fine libraries in <i>Italy</i>, where he might have seen the
following exquisite  <i>bijous</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="tbp">Ever ardent in his love of past learning, and not less voracious in
his bibliomaniacal appetites, was the well known <span class="smcap">Narcissus Luttrell</span>.
Nothing&mdash;if we may judge from the spirited sketch of his book
character, by the able editor<a name="FNanchor_366_372" id="FNanchor_366_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_372" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> of Dryden's works&mdash;nothing would
seem to have escaped his Lynx-like vigilance. Let the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span> object be what
it would (especially if it related to <i>poetry</i>) let the volume be
great or small, or contain good, bad, or indifferent warblings of the
muse&mdash;his insatiable craving had "stomach for them all." We may
consider his collection as the fountain head of those copious streams
which, after fructifying the libraries of many bibliomaniacs in the
first half of the eighteenth century, settled, for a while, more
determinedly, in the curious book-reservoir of a Mr. <span class="smcap">Wynne</span>&mdash;and hence,
breaking up, and taking a different direction towards the collections
of Farmer, Steevens, and others, they have almost lost their identity
in the innumerable rivulets which now inundate the book-world.</p>

the purchase. His collection contains the earliest editions

<i>Bibliotheca Luttrelliana</i>. Mr. Wynne lived at Little
Chelsea; and built his library in a room which had the
reputation of having been <span class="smcap">Locke's</span> <i>study</i>. Here he used to
sit, surrounded by innumerable books&mdash;a "great part being
formed by an eminent and curious collector in the last
century"&mdash;viz. the aforesaid Narcissus Luttrell. (See the
title to the Catalogue of his Library.) His books were sold
by auction in 1786; and, that the reader may have some faint
idea of the treasures contained in the <i>Bibliotheca
Wynniana</i>, he is presented with the following extracts:

<p>Lots 23-4 comprised a great number of "<i>Old Poetry and

9<i>s.</i> Lot 376 comprehended a "<i>Collection of Old

which were sold for 38<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> Never, to be sure, was a
precious collection of English History and Poetry so
wretchedly detailed to the public, in an auction catalogue!
It should be noticed that a great number of poetical tracts
was disposed of, previous to the sale, to Dr. <span class="smcap">Farmer</span>, who
gave not more than forty guineas for them. The Doctor was
also a determined purchaser at the sale, and I think the
ingenious Mr. Waldron aided the illustrious commentator of
Shakspeare with many a choice volume. It may be worth adding
that Wynne was the author of an elegant work, written in the
form of dialogues, entitled <i>Eunomus</i>, or <i>Discourses upon
the Laws of England</i>, 4 vols., 8vo. It happened to be
published at the time when Sir William Blackstone's
<i>Commentaries on the Laws of England</i> made their appearance;
and, in consequence, has seen only three editions: the
latter being published in 1809, 2 vols., 8vo.</p>

The reader will find an animated eulogy on this great
nobleman in Walpole's <i>Anecdotes of Painters</i>, vol. iv.,
227; part of which was transcribed by Joseph Warton for his
variorum edition of Pope's works, and thence copied into the
recent edition of the same by the Rev. W.L. Bowles. But
<span class="smcap">Pembroke</span> deserved a more particular notice. Exclusively of
his fine statues and architectural decorations, the Earl
contrived to procure a great number of curious and rare
books; and the testimonies of Maittaire (who speaks indeed
of him with a sort of rapture!) and Palmer show that the
productions of Jenson and Caxton were no strangers to his
library. <i>Annales Typographici</i>, vol. i., 13. edit. 1719.
<i>History of Printing</i>, p. 5. "There is nothing that so
surely proves the pre-eminence of virtue more than the
universal admiration of mankind, and the respect paid it by
persons in opposite interests; and, more than this, it is a
sparkling gem which even time does not destroy: it is hung
up in the Temple of Fame, and respected for ever."
<i>Continuation of Granger</i>, vol. i., 37, &amp;c. "He raised
(continues Mr. Noble) a collection of antiques that were
unrivalled by any subject. His learning made him a fit
companion for the literati. Wilton will ever be a monument
of his extensive knowledge; and the princely presents it
contains, of the high estimation in which he was held by
foreign potentates, as well as by the many monarchs he saw
and served at home. He lived rather as a primitive
christian; in his behaviour, meek; in his dress, plain:
rather retired, conversing but little." Burnet, in the
<i>History of his own Times</i>, has spoken of the Earl with
spirit and propriety. Thus far the first edition of the
Bibliomania. From an original MS. letter of Anstis to Ames
(in the possession of Mr. John Nichols) I insert the
following memoranda, concerning the book celebrity of Lord
Pembroke. "I had the book of Juliana Barnes (says Anstis)
printed at St. Albans, 1486, about hunting, which was
afterwards reprinted by W. de Worde at Westminster,
1496&mdash;but the <span class="smcap">Earl of Pembroke</span> would not rest till he got it
from me." From a letter to Lewis (the biographer of Caxton)
by the same person, dated Oct. 11, 1737, Anstis says that
"the Earl of Pembroke would not suffer him to rest till he
had presented it to him." He says also that "he had a later
edition of the same, printed in 1496, <i>on parchment</i>, by W.
de Worde, which he had given away: but he could send to the
person who had it." From another letter, dated May 8, 1740,
this "person" turns out to be the famous <span class="smcap">John Murray</span>; to
whom we are shortly to be introduced. The copy, however, is
said to be "imperfect; but the St. Albans book, a fair
folio." In this letter, Lord Pembroke's library is said to
hold "the greatest collection of the first books printed in
England." Perhaps the reader will not be displeased to be
informed that in the <i>Antiquities of Glastonbury</i>, published
by Hearne, 1722, p. <span class="smcap">lviii</span>, there is a medal, with the
reverse, of one of the Earl's ancestors in Queen Elizabeth's
time, which had escaped Evelyn. It was lent to Hearne by Sir
Philip Sydenham, who was at the expense of having the plate
engraved.</p>

<p class="tp">While this nobleman was the general theme of literary praise there
lived a <i>Bibliomaniacal Triumvirate</i> of the names of <span class="smcap">Bagford</span>, <span class="smcap">Murray</span>,

noticed at <a href="#Page_217">p. 217</a>, ante. We will now discuss the merits of
the above, <i>seriatim</i>. And first of <span class="smcap">John Bagford</span>, "by
profession a bookseller; who frequently travelled into
Holland and other parts, in search of scarce books and
valuable prints, and brought a vast number into this
kingdom, the greater part of which were purchased by the
Earl of Oxford. He had been in his younger days a shoemaker;
and for the many curiosities wherewith he enriched the
famous library of Dr. John More, Bishop of Ely, his Lordship
got him admitted into the Charter House. He died in 1716,
aged 65; after his death, Lord Oxford purchased all his
collections and papers for his library: these are now in the
Harleian collection in the British Museum. In 1707 were
published, in the Philosophical transactions, his Proposals
for a General History of Printing."&mdash;Bowyer and Nichol's
<i>Origin of Printing</i>, pp. 164, 189, note. It has been my
fortune (whether good or bad remains to be proved) not only
to transcribe, and cause to be reprinted, the slender
Memorial of Printing in the Philosophical Transactions,
drawn up by Wanley for Bagford, but to wade through
<i>forty-two</i> folio volumes, in which Bagford's materials for
a History of Printing are incorporated, in the British
Museum: and from these, I think I have furnished myself with
a pretty correct notion of the collector of them. Bagford
was the most hungry and rapacious of all book and print
collectors; and, in his ravages, he spared neither the most
delicate nor costly specimens. He seems always to have
expressed his astonishment at the most common productions;
and his paper in the Philosophical Transactions betrays such
simplicity and ignorance that one is astonished how my Lord
Oxford, and the learned Bishop of Ely, could have employed
so credulous a bibliographical forager. A modern collector
and lover of <i>perfect</i> copies, will witness, with
shuddering, among Bagford's immense collection of
title-pages in the Museum, the frontispieces of the
Complutensian Polyglot, and Chauncy's History of
Hertfordshire, torn out to illustrate a History of Printing.
His enthusiasm, however, carried him through a great deal of
laborious toil; and he supplied in some measure, by this
qualification, the want of other attainments. His whole mind
was devoted to book-hunting; and his integrity and diligence
probably made his employers overlook his many failings. His
handwriting is scarcely legible, and his orthography is
still more wretched; but if he was ignorant, he was humble,
zealous, and grateful; and he has certainly done something
towards the accomplishment of that desirable object, an
accurate <span class="smcap">general history of printing</span>. The preceding was
inserted in the <i>first edition</i> of this work. It is
incumbent on me to say something more, and less declamatory,
of so extraordinary a character; and as my sources of
information are such as do not fall into the hands of the
majority of readers, I trust the prolixity of what follows,
appertaining to the aforesaid renowned bibliomaniac, will be
pardoned&mdash;at least by the lover of curious biographical
memoranda. My old friend, Tom Hearne, is my chief authority.
In the preface to that very scarce, but rather curious than
valuable, work, entitled <i>Guil. Roper Vita D. Thomæ Mori</i>,
1716, 8vo., we have the following brief notice of Bagford:
§. ix. "Epistolas et Orationes excipit Anonymi Scriptoris
chronicon; quod idcirco Godstovianum appellare visum est,
quia in illud forte fortuna inciderim, quum, anno <span class="smcap">mdccxv.</span>
una cum <span class="smcap">Joannæ Bagfordio</span>, amico egregio ad rudera Prioratûs
de Godstowe juxta Oxoniam animi recreandi gratia,
perambularem. De illo vero me prius certiorem fecerat ipse
Bagfordius, qui magno cum nostro m&#339;rore paullo post
Londini obiit, die nimirum quinto Maij anno <span class="smcap">mdccxvi.</span> quum
jam annum ætatis sexagessimum quintum inplerisset, ut è
litteris intelligo amici ingenio et humanitate ornati
Jacobei Sothebeii, junioris, qui, si quis alius, è
familiaribus erat Bagfordii. Virum enimvero ideo mihi quam
maxime hâc occasione lugendum est, quod amicum probitate et
modestia præditum amiserim, virumque cum primis diligentem
et peritum intercidisse tam certum sit quam quod
certissimum. Quamvis enim artes liberales nunquam
didicisset, vi tamen ingenii ductus, eruditus plane evasit;
et, ut quod verum est dicam, incredibile est quam feliciter
res abstrusas in historiis veteribus explicaverit, nodosque
paullo difficiliores ad artis typographicæ incunabula
spectantes solverit et expedierit. Expertus novi quod
scribo. Quotiescunque enim ipsum consului (et quidem id
sæpissime faciendum erat) perpetuo mihi aliter atque
exspectaveram satisfecit, observationis itidem nonnunquam
tales addens, quales antea neque mihi neque viris longe
doctioribus in mentem venerant. Quidni itaque virum magnum
fuisse pronunciarem, præcipue quum nostra sententia illi
soli magni sint censendi, qui recte agant, et sint vere boni
et virtute præditi?"&mdash;<i>Præf.</i> pp. xxi., ii. In Hearne's
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: preface">perface</span> to <i>Walter
Hemingford's</i> history, Bagford is again briefly introduced:
"At vero in hoc genere fragmenta colligendi omnes quidem
alios (quantum ego existimare possum) facile superavit
<span class="smcap">Joannes Bagfordius</span>, de quo apud Hemingum, &amp;c. Incredibile
est, quanta usus sit diligentia in laciniis veteribus
coacervandis. Imo in hoc labore quidem tantum versari
exoptabat quantum potuit, tantum autem re vera versabatur,
quantum ingenio (nam divino sane fruebatur) quantum mediocri
doctrina (nam neque ingenue, neque liberaliter, unquam fuit
educatus) quantum usu valuit," p. ciii. The reader here
finds a reference to what is said of Bagford, in the
<i>Hemingi Wigornensis Chartularium</i>; which, though copious,
is really curious and entertaining, and is forthwith
submitted to his consideration. "It was therefore very
laudable in my friend, Mr. <span class="smcap">J. Bagford</span> (who I think was born
in Fetter-lane, London) to employ so much of his time as he
did in collecting remains of antiquity. Indeed he was a man
of a very surprising genius, and had his education (for he
was first a shoe-maker, and afterwards for some time a
book-seller) been equal to his natural genius, he would have
proved a much greater man than he was. And yet, without this
education, he was certainly the greatest man in the world in
his way. I do not hear of any monument erected to his
memory, but 'twas not without reason that a worthy
gentleman, now living in London, designed the following
epitaph for him:</p>

<p>"'Tis very remarkable that, in collecting, his care did not
extend itself to books and to fragments of books only; but
even to the very <i>Covers</i>, and to <i>Bosses</i> and <i>Clasps</i>; and
all this that he might, with greater ease, compile the
History of Printing, which he had undertaken, but did not
finish. In this noble work he intended a Discourse about
<i>Binding Books</i> (in which he might have improved what I have
said elsewhere about the ancient Æstels) and another about
the <i>Art of making Paper</i>, in both which his observations
were very accurate. Nay, his skill <i>in paper</i> was so
exquisite that, at first view, he could tell the place
where, and the time when, any paper was made, though at
never so many years' distance. I well remember that, when I
was reading over a famous book of collections (written by
John Lawerne, Monk of Worcester, and now preserved) in the
Bodleian Library, Mr. Bagford came to me (as he would often
come thither on purpose to converse with me about
curiosities) and that he had no sooner seen the book, but he
presently described the time when, and the place where, the
paper of which it consists, was made. He was indefatigable
in his searches, and was so ambitious of seeing what he had
heard of, relating to his noble design, that he had made
several journies into Holland to see the famous books there.
Nor was he less thirsty after other antiquities, but, like
old John Stow, was for seeing himself, if possible (although
he travelled on foot), what had been related to him.
Insomuch that I cannot doubt, but were he now living, he
would have expressed a very longing desire of going to
Worcester, were it for no other reason but to be better
satisfied about the famous monumental stones mentioned by
Heming (<i>Chart, Wigorn.</i>, p. 342), as he often declared a
most earnest desire of walking with me (though I was
diverted from going) to Guy's Cliff by Warwick, when I was
printing that most rare book called, <i>Joannis Rossi
Antiquarii Warwicensis Historia Regum Angliæ</i>. And I am apt
to think that he would have shewed as hearty an inclination
of going to Stening in Sussex, that being the place
(according to Asser's Life of Ælfred the Great) where K.
Ethelwulph (father of K. Alfred) was buried, though others
say it was at Winchester," &amp;c. "Mr. <span class="smcap">Bagford</span> was as
communicative as he was knowing: so that some of the chief
curiosities in some of our best libraries are owing to him;
for which reason it was that the late <i>Bishop of Ely</i>, Dr.
<span class="smcap">More</span> (who received so much from him), as an instance of
gratitude, procured him a place in the Charter-House. I wish
all places were as well bestowed. For as Mr. Bagford was,
without all dispute, a very worthy man, so, being a despiser
of money, he had not provided for the necessities of old
age. He never looked upon those as true philosophers that
aimed at heaping up riches, and, in that point, could never
commend that otherwise great man, Seneca, who had about two
hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, at use in
Britain; the loan whereof had been thrust upon the Britains,
whether they would or no. He would rather extol such men as
a certain rector near Oxford, whose will is thus put down in
writing, by Richard Kedermister, the last abbot but one of
Winchcomb (<i>Leland Collect.</i> vol. vi., 168), in the margin
of a book (I lately purchased) called <i>Hieronymi Cardinalis
Vitas Patrum</i>, Lugd. <span class="smcap">mcccccii.</span> 4to. Nihil habeo, nihil
debeo, benedicamus Domino. Testamentum cujusdam rectoris,
juxta Oxoniam decedentis circiter annum salutis, 1520." "Nor
was Mr. Bagford versed only in our own old writers, but in
those likewise of other countries, particularly the Roman.
His skill in that part of the Roman history that immediately
relates to Britain is sufficiently evident from his curious
letter, printed at the beginning of Leland's Collectanea.
That he might be the better acquainted with the Roman
stations, and the several motions of the soldiers from one
place to another, he used to pick up coins, and would, upon
occasion, discourse handsomely, and very pertinently, about
them; yet he would keep none, but would give them to his
friends, telling them (for he was exemplarily modest and
humble) that he had neither learning nor sagacity enough to
explain and illustrate them, and that therefore it was more
proper they should be in the possession of some able
persons. He would have done any thing to retrieve a Roman
author, and would have given any price for so much as a
single fragment (not yet discovered) of the learned
commentaries, written by Agrippina, mother to Nero, touching
the fortunes of her house, which are (as I much fear) now
utterly lost, excepting the fragment or two cited out of
them by Pliny the elder and Cornelius Tacitus; as he would
also have stuck at no price for a grammar <i>printed at
Tavistock</i>, commonly called <span class="bl">The long Grammar</span>. When he went
abroad he was never idle, but if he could not meet with
things of a better character, he would divert himself with
looking over <i>Ballads</i>, and he was always mightily pleased
if he met with any that were old. Anthony à Wood made good
collections, with respect to ballads, but he was far outdone
by Mr. Bagford. Our modern ballads are, for the most part,
romantic; but the old ones contain matters of fact, and were
generally written by good scholars. In these old ones were
couched the transactions of our great heroes: they were a
sort of Chronicles. So that the wise founder of New College
permitted them to be sung, by the fellows of that college,
upon extraordinary days. In those times, the poets thought
they had done their duty when they had observed truth, and
put the accounts they undertook to write, into rhythm,
without extravagantly indulging their fancies. Nobody knew
this better than Mr. Bagford; for which reason he always
seemed almost ravished when he happened to light upon old
rhythms, though they might not, perhaps, be so properly
ranged under the title of ballads," &amp;c., pp. 656-663. Being
unable to furnish a portrait of Bagford (although I took
some little trouble to procure one) I hope the reader&mdash;if
his patience be not quite exhausted&mdash;will endeavour to
console himself, in lieu thereof, with a specimen of
Bagford's epistolary composition; which I have faithfully
copied from the original among the <i>Sloanian MSS.</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>.

<p>I wish it were in my power to collect information, equally
acceptable with the foregoing, respecting the above-named
<span class="smcap">John Murray</span>; but Hearne, who was his intimate friend, has
been very sparing in his anecdotes of him, having left us
but a few desultory notices, written chiefly in the Latin
language. The earliest mention of him that I find is the
following: "Verum illud præcipue mentionem meretur, quod
mutuo accepi, schedula una et altera jam excusa, á <span class="smcap">Joanne
Murario</span> Londinensi, rei antiquariæ perscrutatore diligenti,
cui eo nomine gratias ago." "Denique subdidi descriptionem
fenestrarum depictarum ecclesiæ parochialis de Fairford in
agro Glocestriensi, è schedula quam mutuo sumpsi ab amico
supra laudato Johanne Murrario, qui per literas etiam
certiorem me fecit è codice quodam vetusto MS. fuisse
extractum. Neque dubito quin hic idem fuerit Codex quem olim
in ecclesia de Fairford adservatum surripuisse nebulonem

necnon ætate et scientia venerandus." Præf: p. <span class="smcap">xxii.</span> <i>Guil.
Roperi Vita Thomæ Mori</i>, 1716, 8vo., edit. Hearne. There is
another slight mention of Murray, by Hearne, in the latter's
edition of <i>Thom. Caii. Vindic. Antiq. Acad. Oxon</i>, vol.
ii., 803-4&mdash;where he discourses largely upon the former's
copy of <i>Rastel's Pastyme of People</i>: a book which will be
noticed by me very fully on a future occasion. At present,
it may suffice to observe that a perfect copy of it is
probably the rarest English book in existence. There is a
curious copper plate print of Murray, by Vertue, in which
our bibliomaniac's right arm is resting upon some books
entitled "<i>Hearne's Works, Sessions Papers, Tryals of
Witches</i>." Beneath is this inscription:</p>

<p>Of the above-mentioned <span class="smcap">Thomas Britton</span>, I am enabled to
present a very curious and interesting account, from a work
published by Hearne, of no very ordinary occurrence, and in
the very words of Hearne himself. It is quite an unique
picture. "Before I dismiss this subject, I must beg leave to
mention, and to give a short account of, one that was
intimately acquainted with Mr. Bagford, and was also a great
man, though of but ordinary education. The person I mean is
Mr. <span class="smcap">Thos. Britton</span>, the famous <i>Musical Small Coal Man</i>, who
was born at or near Higham Ferrers in Northamptonshire.
Thence he went to London, where he bound himself apprentice
to a small coal man in St. John Baptist's Street. After he
had served his full time of seven years, his master gave him
a sum of money not to set up. Upon this, Tom went into
Northamptonshire again, and after he had spent his money, he
returned again to London, set up the <i>small coal trade</i>
(notwithstanding his master was still living) and withall,
he took a stable, and turned it into a house, which stood
the next door to the little gate of St. John's of Jerusalem,
next Clerkenwell Green. Some time after he had settled here,
he became acquainted with Dr. Garenciers, his near
neighbour, by which means he became an excellent chymist,
and perhaps, he performed such things in that profession, as
had never been done before, with little cost and charge, by
the help of a moving elaboratory, that was contrived and
built by himself, which was much admired by all of that
faculty that happened to see it; insomuch that a certain
gentleman in Wales was so much taken with it that he was at
the expense of carrying him down into that country, on
purpose to build him such another, which Tom performed to
the gentleman's very great satisfaction, and for the same he
received of him a very handsome and generous gratuity.
Besides his great skill in chymistry, he was as famous for
his knowledge in the <i>Theory of Music</i>; in the practical
part of which Faculty he was likewise very considerable. He
was so much addicted to it that he pricked with his own hand
(very neatly and accurately), and left behind him, a
valuable collection of music, mostly pricked by himself,
which was sold upon his death for near a hundred pounds. Not
to mention the excellent collection of <span class="smcap">printed books</span>, that
he also left behind him, both of chemistry and music.
Besides these books that he left behind him, he had, some
years before his death, sold by auction a <i>noble collection
of books</i>, most of them in the <i>Rosacrucian Faculty</i> (of
which he was a great admirer): whereof there is a printed
catalogue extant (as there is of those that were sold after
his death), which I have often looked over with no small
surprize and wonder, and particularly for the great number
of MSS. in the before mentioned faculties that are specified
in it. He had, moreover, a considerable collection of
musical instruments, which were sold for fourscore pounds
upon his death, which happened in September 1714, being
upwards of threescore years of age; and (he) lyes buried in
the church-yard of Clerkenwell, without monument or
inscription: being attended to his grave, in a very solemn
and decent manner, by a great concourse of people,
especially of such as frequented the Musical club, that was
kept up for many years at his own charges (he being a man of
a very generous and liberal spirit) at his own little cell.
He appears by the print of him (done since his death) to
have been a man of an ingenuous countenance and of a
sprightly temper. It also represents him as a comely person,
as indeed he was; and withal, there is a modesty expressed
in it every way agreeable to him. Under it are these verses,
which may serve instead of an epitaph:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">

Tho' mean thy rank, yet in thy humble cell<br />
Did gentle peace and arts unpurchas'd dwell;<br />

Came willing guests to poor <span class="smcap">Philemon's</span> grove.<br />
Let useless pomp behold, and blush to find<br />
So low a station, such a liberal mind.<br />
</td>

<p>In short, he was an extraordinary and very valuable man,
much admired by the gentry; even those of the best quality,
and by all others of the more inferior rank, that had any
manner of regard for probity, sagacity, diligence, and
humility. I say humility, because, though he was so much
famed for his knowledge, and might, therefore, have lived
very reputably without his trade, yet he continued it to his
death, not thinking it to be at all beneath him. Mr. <span class="smcap">Bagford</span>
and he used frequently to converse together, and when they
met <i>they seldom parted very soon</i>. Their conversation was
very often about <span class="smcap">old mss.</span> and the havock made of them. They
both agreed to retrieve what fragments of antiquity they
could, and, upon that occasion, they would frequently divert
themselves in talking of <span class="smcap">old chronicles</span>, which both loved to
read, though, among our more late Chronicles printed in
English, Isaackson's was what they chiefly preferred for a
general knowledge of things; a book which was much esteemed
also by those two eminent Chronologers, Bishop Lloyd and Mr.
Dodwell. By the way, I cannot but observe that Isaackson's
Chronicle is really, for the most part, Bishop Andrews's;
Isaackson being amanuensis to the bishop." <i>Hemingi
Chartular. Eccles. Wigornien.</i>, vol. ii., 666-9, Edit.
Hearne. See also, <i>Robert of Glocester's Chronicle</i>, vol.
i., p. <span class="smcap">lxxii.</span> We will close our account of this perfectly
<i>unique</i> bibliomaniac by subjoining the title of the
<i>Catalogue of his Books</i>; for which I am indebted to the
ever-active and friendly assistance of Mr. Heber. The volume
is so rare that the late Mr. Reed told Mr. H. he had never
seen another copy: but another has recently been sold, and
is now in the curious collection of Mr. R. Baker. "The
Library of Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Britton</span>, Small-coal man, Deceas'd:
who, at his own charge, kept up a Concort of Musick above 40
years, in his little Cottage. Being a curious Collection of
every Ancient and Uncommon book in Divinity, History,
Physick, Chemistry, Magick, &amp;c. Also a Collection of MSS.
chiefly on vellum. <i>Which will be sold by auction at Paul's
Coffee House, &amp;c., the 24th day of January, 1714-15, at Five
in the Evening.</i> By Thomas Ballard, Esq., 8vo., p. 30.
Containing 102 articles in folio&mdash;274 in 4to.&mdash;664 in
octavo&mdash;50 pamphlets&mdash;and 23 MSS." A few of the works, in
octavo, were sufficiently amatory. The third and last
character above mentioned, as making this illustrious
bibliomaniacal triumvirate complete, is <span class="smcap">Thomas Hearne</span>. That
Pope, in the verses which Lysander has quoted, meant this
distinguished antiquary seems hardly to be questioned; and
one wonders at the Jesuitical note of Warburton, in striving
to blow the fumes of the poet's satire into a different
direction. They must settle upon poor Hearne's head: for
<span class="smcap">Wanley's</span> antiquarian talents were equally beyond the touch
of satire and the criticism of the satirist. Warton has,
accordingly, admitted that <span class="smcap">Hearne</span> was represented under the
character of <span class="smcap">Wormius</span>; and he defends the character of Hearne
very justly against the censures of Pope. His eulogy will be
presently submitted to the reader. Gibbon, in his
<i>Posthumous Works</i>, vol. ii., 711, has aimed a deadly blow
at the literary reputation of Hearne; and an admirer of this
critic and historian, as well as an excellent judge of
antiquarian pursuits, has followed up Gibbon's mode of
attack in a yet more merciless manner. He calls him "Thomas
Hearne, of black-letter memory, <i>carbone notandus</i>"&mdash;"a
weaker man (says he) never existed, as his prefaces, so
called, lamentably show." He continues in this hard-hearted
strain: but I have too much humanity to make further
extracts. He admits, however, the utility of most of
Hearne's publications&mdash;"of which he was forced to publish a
few copies, at an extravagant subscription." The remarks of
this (anonymous) writer, upon the neglect of the cultivation
of <span class="smcap">English History</span>, and upon the want of valuable editions
of <span class="smcap">our old Historians</span>, are but too just, and cannot be too
attentively perused. See <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. 58,
pt. 1, 196-8 (A.D. 1788). Thus far in deterioration of poor
Hearne's literary fame. Let us now listen to writers of a
more courteous strain of observation. Prefixed to Tanner's
<i>Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibernica</i>, there is a preface, of
which Dr. Wilkins is the reputed author. The whole of
Hearne's publications are herein somewhat minutely
criticised, and their merits and demerits slightly
discussed. It is difficult to collect the critic's summary
opinion upon Hearne's editorial labours; but he concludes
thus: "Quia autem leporis est mortuis insultare leonibus,
cineres celeberrimi hujus et olim mihi amicissimi viri
turbare, neutiquam in animum inducere possum," p. xlvii. Mr.
Gough, in his <i>British Topography</i>, vol. ii., p. 579, calls
Hearne an "acute observer;" but, unluckily, the subject to
which the reader's attention is here directed discovers our
antiquary to have been in error. J. Warton, in the passage
before alluded to, observes: "In consideration of the many
very accurate and very elegant editions which Hearne
published of our valuable old chronicles, which shed such a
light on English history, he (Hearne) ought not to have been
so severely lashed as in these bitter lines," (quoted in the
text, <a href="#Page_327">p. 327</a>, ante) <i>Pope's Works</i>, edit. Bowles; vol. v.,
232. Let the reader consult also Dr. Pegge's <i>Anonymiana</i>,
in the passages referred to, in the truly valuable index
attached to it, concerning Hearne. Thus much, I submit, may
be fairly said of our antiquary's labours. That the greater
part of them are truly useful, and absolutely necessary for
a philological library, must on all sides be admitted. I
will mention only the <i>Chronicles of Langtoft and Robert of
Gloucester</i>; <i>Adam de Domerham, de rebus Glastoniensibus</i>;
<i>Gulielmus Neubrigensis</i>; <i>Forduni Scotichronicon</i>; and all
his volumes appertaining to <i>Regal Biography</i>:&mdash;these are,
surely, publications of no mean importance. Hearne's
prefaces and appendices are gossiping enough; sometimes,
however, they repay the labour of perusal by curious and
unlooked-for intelligence. Yet it must be allowed that no
literary cook ever enriched his dishes with such little
piquant sauce, as did Hearne: I speak only of their
<i>intrinsic</i> value, for they had a very respectable
exterior&mdash;what Winstanley says of Ogilvey's publications
being, applicable enough to Hearne's;&mdash;they were printed on
"special good paper, and in a very good letter." We will now
say a few words relative to Hearne's habits of study and
living&mdash;taken from his own testimony. In the preface
prefixed to <i>Roper's Life of Sir Thomas More</i>, p. xix.
(edit. 1716), he describes himself "as leading the life of
an ascetic." In the preface to the <i>Annals of Dunstable
Priory</i>, his bibliographical diligence is evinced by his
saying he had "turned over every volume in the Bodleian
Library." In one of his prefaces (to which I am not able
just now to refer) he declares that he was born&mdash;like our
British tars&mdash;"for action:" and indeed his activity was
sufficiently demonstrated; for sometimes he would set about
transcribing for the press papers which had just been put
into his hands. Thus, in the <i>Antiquities of Glastonbury</i>,
p. 326, he writes, "the two following old evidences were
lent me <i>to-day</i> by my friend the Hon. Benedict Leonard
Calvert, Esq." His excessive regard to fidelity of
transcription is, among many other evidences that may be
brought forward, attested in the following passage: "Have
taken particular care (saith Mr. Harcourt, in his letter to
me from Aukenvyke, Sep. 25, 1734) in the copying; well
knowing your exactness." <i>Benedict Abbas</i>, vol ii., 870. But
this servility of transcription was frequently the cause of
multiplying, by propagating, errors. If Hearne had seen the
word "faith" thus disjointed&mdash;"fay the"&mdash;he would have
adhered to this error, for "faythe." As indeed he has
committed a similar one, in the <i>Battle of Agincourt</i>, in
the appendix to Thomas de Elmham: for he writes "breth
reneverichone"&mdash;instead of "brethren everichone"&mdash;as Mr.
Evans has properly printed it, in his recent edition of his
father's <i>Collection of Old Ballads</i>, vol. ii., 334. But
this may be thought trifling. It is certainly not here meant
to justify capriciousness of copying; but surely an obvious
corruption of reading may be restored to its genuine state:
unless, indeed, we are resolved to consider antiquity and
perfection as synonymous terms. But there are some traits in
Hearne's character which must make us forgive and forget
this blind adherence to the errors of antiquity. He was so
warm a lover of every thing in the shape of a <span class="smcap">book</span> that, in
the preface to <i>Alured of Beverley</i>, pp. v. vi., he says
that he jumped almost out of his skin for joy, on reading a
certain MS. which Thomas Rawlinson sent to him ("vix credi
potest qua voluptate, qua animi alacritate, perlegerim,"
&amp;c.). Similar feelings possessed him on a like occasion:
"When the pious author (of the <i>Antiquities of Glastonbury</i>)
first put it (the MS.) into my hands, I read it over with as
much delight as I have done anything whatsoever upon the
subject of antiquity, and I was earnest with him to print
it," p. lxxviii. Hearne's horror of book-devastations is
expressed upon a variety of occasions: and what will
reconcile him to a great portion of <i>modern</i> readers&mdash;and
especially of those who condescend to read this account of
him&mdash;his attachment to the black-letter was marvelously
enthusiastic! Witness his pathetic appeal to the English
nation, in the 26th section of his preface to <i>Robert of
Gloucester's Chronicle</i>, where he almost predicts the
extinction of "right good" literature, on the disappearance
of the <i>black-letter</i>! And here let us draw towards the
close of these <span class="smcap">Hearneana</span>, by contemplating a wood-cut
portrait of this illustrious Bibliomaniac; concerning whose
life and works the reader should peruse the well-known
volumes published at Oxford in 1772, 8vo.: containing the
biographical memoirs of Leland, Bale, Hearne, and Wood.

<p>The library of Hearne was sold in February, 1736, by Osborne
the book-seller; "the lowest price being marked in each

will be disposed to admit the truth, that the collection
contained "a very great variety of uncommon books, and
scarce ever to be met withal," &amp;c. There is, at bottom, a

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Anstis</span><a name="FNanchor_370_376" id="FNanchor_370_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_376" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> stands deservedly the first in the list; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span> he was, in
every respect, a man of thorough benevolent character, as well as a
writer of taste and research. I do not know of any particulars
connected with his library that merit a distinct recital; but he is
introduced here from his connection with the two latter
bibliographers. <span class="smcap">Lewis</span><a name="FNanchor_371_377" id="FNanchor_371_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_377" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> is known to us, both as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span> topographer and
bibliographical antiquary. His <i>Life of Caxton</i> has been reprinted
with additions and corrections; and, in particular, his edition of
<i>Wicliffe's New Testament</i> has been recently put forth by the Rev. Mr.
Baber, in a handsome quarto volume, with valuable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span> emendations. Lewis
was a sharp censurer of Hearne, and was somewhat jealous of the
typographical reputation of Ames. But his integrity and moral
character, as well as his love of rare and curious books, has secured
for him a durable reputation. Of <span class="smcap">Ames</span>, and here&mdash;though a little out
of order&mdash;I may add <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>&mdash;the public has already heard probably
"more than enough." They were both, undoubtedly, men of extraordinary
mental vigour and bodily activity in the darling pursuit which they
cultivated.<a name="FNanchor_372_378" id="FNanchor_372_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_378" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> Indeed, Herbert deserves high commendation; for while
he was rearing, with his own hands, a lofty pyramid of typographical
fame, he seems to have been unconscious of his merits; and, possessing
the most natural and diffident character imaginable, he was always
conjuring up supposed cases of vanity and arrogance, which had no
foundation whatever but in the reveries of a timid imagination. His
<i>Typographical Antiquities</i> are a mass of useful, but occasionally
uninteresting, information. They are as a vast plain, wherein the
traveller sees nothing, immediately, which is beautiful or inviting;
few roses, or cowslips, or daisies; but let him persevere, and walk
only a little way onward, and he will find, in many a shelter'd

<p><a name="Footnote_370_376" id="Footnote_370_376"></a><a href="#FNanchor_370_376">[370]</a> The reader will be pleased to consult the
account of Earl Pembroke, <a href="#Page_325">p. 325</a>, ante, where he will find a
few traits of the bibliomaniacal character of <span class="smcap">Anstis</span>. He is
here informed, from the same authority, that when Anstis
"acquainted <span class="smcap">Bagford</span> that he would find in Rymer a commission
granted to Caxton, appointing him ambassador to the Duchess
of Burgundy, he (Bagford) was transported with joy." Of
<span class="smcap">Hearne</span> he thus speaks: "I am ashamed that Mr. Hearne hath
made so many mistakes about the translation of <i>Boetius,
printed at Tavistock</i>; which book I had, and gave it to the
Duke of Bedford." But in another letter (to Lewis) Anstis
says, "I lent this book to one Mr. Ryder, who used me
scurvily, by presenting it, without my knowledge, to the
Duke of Bedford." There are some curious particulars in this
letter about the abbey of Tavistock. Anstis's <i>Order of the
Garter</i> is a valuable book; and will one day, I
prognosticate, retrieve the indifferent credit it now
receives in the book-market. The author loved rare and
curious volumes dearly; and was, moreover, both liberal and
prompt in his communications. The reader will draw his own
conclusions on Anstis's comparative merit with Lewis and
Ames, when he reaches the end of the second note after the
present one.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_371_377" id="Footnote_371_377"></a><a href="#FNanchor_371_377">[371]</a> Concerning the Rev. <span class="smcap">John Lewis</span>, I am enabled
to lay before the reader some particulars now published for
the first time, and of a nature by no means uninteresting to
the lovers of literary anecdote. His printed works, and his
bibliographical character, together with his conduct towards
Ames, have been already sufficiently described to the
public: <i>Typographical Antiquities</i>, vol. i., 30-3. And
first, the aforesaid reader and lovers may peruse the
following extract from an original letter by Lewis to Ames:
"I have no other design, in being so free with you, than to
serve you, by doing all I can to promote your credit and
reputation. I take it, that good sense and judgment,
attended with care and accuracy in making and sorting a
collection, suits every one's palate: and that they must
have none at all who are delighted with trifles and play
things fit only for fools and children: such, for the most
part, as <span class="smcap">Thomas Hearne</span> dished out for his chaps, among whom
I was so silly as to rank myself." Again, to the same
person, he thus makes mention of <span class="smcap">Lord Oxford</span> and Hearne: "I
can truly say I never took ill any thing which you have
written to me: but heartily wish you well to succeed in the
execution of your projects. I han't sense to see, by the
death of Lord Oxford, how much more you are likely to make
your account better. But time will shew. I don't understand
what you mean by his having a love to surprize people with
his vast communications. Dr. R(awlinson, qu.?) tells me he
knew nobody who had so free a use of his Lordship's rarities
as T. Hearne, a sure proof of the exactness and solidity of
his Lordship's judgment. But Hearne answered, perhaps, his
Lordship's design of making the world have a very great
opinion of his collections, and setting an inestimable value
on them. And this Hearne attempted; but his daubing is, I
think, too coarse, and the smoke of his incense troublesome
and suffocating." But it is to the loan of a copy of Lewis's
folio edition of the <i>History of the Translations of the
Bible</i>, belonging to my friend Mr. G.V. Neunburg, that I am
indebted for the following further, and more interesting,
particulars. This valuable copy, illustrated with some rare
prints, and charged with numerous MS. memoranda, contains
some original letters to Lewis by the famous Dr. White
Kennet, Bishop of Peterborough: from which these extracts
are taken. "Jan. 23, 1720-1. Dear Sir; I thank you for your
kind acceptance of the advice to my clergy: well meant, I
pray God well applied. I have wisht long to see your <i>Life
of Wiclif</i>, and shall now impatiently expect it. I am not
surprised that a man of dignity, near you, should be jealous
of publishing an impartial account of that good old
evangelical author, &amp;c. I have a mighty veneration for
Wicliff, and am the more angry with Mr. Russell for
deceiving the world in his promise of the Bible, after
proposals given and money taken. But he has in other
respects behaved so very basely that, forgiving him, I have
done with him for ever. I would not have you discouraged, by
an ungrateful world, or by a sharp bookseller. Go on, and
serve truth and peace what you can, and God prosper your
labours." Signed "Wh. Peterbor." "Feb. 20, 1720-1. You
perceive your own unhappiness in not being able to attend
the press. I cannot but importune you to revise the whole,
to throw the additions and corrections into their proper
places, to desire all your friends and correspondents to
suggest any amendments, or any new matter; in order to
publish a new correct edition that will be a classic in our
history, &amp;c.&mdash;If the booksellers object against a second
edition till the full disposal of the first, I hope we may
buy them off with subscription for a new impression; wherein
my name should stand for six copies, and better example I
hope would be given by more able friends. I pray God bless
your labours and reward them." Several letters follow, in
which this amiable prelate and learned antiquary sends Lewis
a good deal of valuable information for his proposed second
edition of the Life of Wicliffe; but which was never put to
press. One more extract only from the Bishop of
Peterborough, and we bid farewell to the Rev. John Lewis: a
very respectable bibliomaniac. "Rev. Sir; In respect to you
and your good services to the church and our holy religion,
I think fit to acquaint you that, in the <i>Weekly Journal</i>,
published this day, Oct. 28 (1721), by <i>Mr. Mist</i>, there is
a scandalous advertisement subscribed M. Earbury, beginning
thus: 'Whereas a pretended <i>Vindication of John Wickliffe</i>
has been published under the name of one Lewis of Margate,
by the incitement, as the preface asserts, of the Archbishop
of Canterbury, and in the same I am injuriously reflected
upon as a scurrilous writer, this is to inform the public
that I shall reserve the author for a more serious whipping
in my leisure hours, and in the meantime give him a short
correction for his benefit, if he has grace and sense to
take it'&mdash;and ending thus&mdash;'Why does this author persuade
the world the late Archbishop of Canterbury could have any
veneration for the memory of one who asserts God ought to
obey the devil; or that he could be desirous to open the
impure fountains from whence the filth of Bangorianism has
been conveyed to us? M. <span class="smcap">Earbury</span>." "I confess (proceeds the
bishop) I don't know that, in the worst of causes, there has
appeared a more ignorant, insolent, and abandoned writer
than this Matth. Earbury. Whether you are to answer, or not
to answer, the F. according to his folly, I must leave to
your discretion. Yet I cannot but wish you would revise the
Life of Wickliffe; and, in the preface, justly complain of
the spiteful injuries done to his memory, and, through his
sides, to our Reformation. I have somewhat to say to you on
that head, if you think to resume it. I am, in the mean
time, your affectionate friend and brother, <span class="smcap">Wh. Petesbor</span>."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_372_378" id="Footnote_372_378"></a><a href="#FNanchor_372_378">[372]</a> It is unnecessary for me to add any thing
here to the copious details respecting these eminent
bibliomaniacs, <span class="smcap">Ames</span> and <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>, which have already been
presented to the public in the first volume of the new
edition of the <i>Typographical Antiquities</i> of our own

<p class="tp">By mentioning Herbert in the present place, I have a little inverted
the order of my narrative. A crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span> distinguished bibliomaniacs, in

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_373_379" id="Footnote_373_379"></a><a href="#FNanchor_373_379">[373]</a> <span class="smcap">Thomas Baker</span> was a learned antiquary in most
things respecting <i>Typography</i> and <i>Bibliography</i>; and seems
to have had considerable influence with that distinguished
corps, composed of Hearne, Bagford, Middleton, Anstis, and
Ames, &amp;c. His life has been written by the Rev. Robert
Masters, Camb., 1784, 8vo.; and from the "Catalogue of
forty-two folio volumes of MS. collections by Mr.
Baker"&mdash;given to the library of St. John's College,
Cambridge&mdash;which the biographer has printed at the end of
the volume&mdash;there is surely sufficient evidence to warrant
us in concluding that the above-mentioned Thomas Baker was
no ordinary bibliomaniac. To Hearne in particular (and
indeed to almost every respectable author who applied to
him) he was kind and communicative; hence he is frequently
named by the former in terms of the most respectful
admiration: thus&mdash;"Vir amicissimus, educatus optime,
emendatus vitâ, doctrinâ clarus, moribus singularis et
perjucundus, exemplum antiquitatis, cujus judicio plurimum
esse tribuendum mecum fatebuntur litterati:" <i>Vita Mori</i>, p.
<span class="smcap">xviii.</span> In his preface to the <i>Antiquities of Glastonbury</i>,
p. <span class="smcap">cxxx.</span>, Hearne calls him "that great man;" and again, in
his <i>Walter Hemingford</i>, vol. i., p. <span class="smcap">xvii.</span>&mdash;"amicus
eruditissimus, mihi summe colendus; is nempe, qui è scriniis
suis MSS. tam multa meam in gratiam deprompsit." Indeed,
Hearne had good occasion to speak well of the treasures of
Baker's "<i>scrinia</i>;" as the Appendix to his <i>Thomas de
Elmham</i> alone testifies. Of Baker's abilities and private
worth, we have the testimonies of Middleton (<i>Origin of
Printing</i>, p. 5) and Warburton. The latter thus mentions
him: "Good old Mr. Baker, of St John's College, has indeed,
been very obliging. The people of St. John's almost adore
the man." <i>Masters's Life of Baker</i>, p. 94. This authority
also informs us that "Mr. Baker had, for many years before
his death, been almost a recluse, and seldom went farther
than the college walks, unless to a coffee-house in an
evening, after chapel, where he commonly spent an hour with
great chearfulness, conversing with a select number of his
friends and acquaintance upon literary subjects," p. 108.
Every thing the most amiable, and, I had almost said,
enviable, is here said of the virtues of his head and heart;
and that this venerable bibliomaniac should have reached his
80th year is at least a demonstration that tarrying amongst
folios and octavos, from morn till night (which Baker used
to do, in St. John's Library, for nearly 20 years together),
does not unstring the nerves, or dry up the juices, of the
human frame. Yet a little further extension of this note,
gentle reader, and then we bid adieu to Thomas Baker, of
ever respectable book-memory. Among the MSS., once the
property of Herbert, which I purchased at the late sale of
Mr. Gough's MSS., I obtained a volume full of extracts from
original letters between Baker and Ames; containing also the
<i>Will</i> of the former, which is not inserted in Master's Life
of him, nor in the <i>Biographia Britannica</i>. The original
documents are in his Majesty's library, and were bought at
the sale of Mr. Tutet's books, A.D. 1786; n<span class="super">o</span>. 375. From
this will, as Herbert has copied it, the reader is presented
with the following strong proofs of the bibliomaniacal
"ruling passion, strong in death," of our illustrious
antiquary. But let us not omit the manly tone of piety with
which this Will commences. "In the name of God, Amen! I,
<span class="smcap">Thomas Baker</span>, ejected Fellow of St. John's college,
Cambridge, do make my last will and testament, as follows:
First, I commend my soul into the hands of Almighty God (my
most gracious and good God), my faithful Creator and
merciful Redeemer, and, in all my dangers and difficulties,
a most constant protector. Blessed for ever be his holy
name." "As to the temporal goods which it hath pleased the
same good God to bestow upon me (such as all men ought to be
content with) and are, I bless God, neither poverty nor
riches&mdash;I dispose of them in the following manner." Here
follow a few of his book bequests, which may be worth the
attention of those whose pursuits lead them to a particular
examination of these authors. "Whereas I have made a deed of
gift or sale for one guinea, of 21 volumes in folio, of my
own hand-writing, to the Right Honourable <span class="smcap">Edward Earl of
Oxford</span>, I confirm and ratify that gift by this my last will.
And I beg his lordship's acceptance of 'em, being sensible
that they are of little use or value, with two other volumes
in fol., markt Vol. 19, 20, since convey'd to him in like
manner. To my dear cosin, George Baker, of Crook, Esq., I
leave the <i>Life of Cardinal Wolsey</i>, noted with my own hand,
<i>Lord Clarendon's History</i>, with cuts and prints; and
<i>Winwood's Memorials</i>, in three volumes, fol., with a five
pound (Jacobus) piece of gold, only as a mark of respect and
affection, since he does not want it. To my worthy kinsman
and Friend Mr. George Smith, I leave <i>Godwin de Præsulibus
Angliæ</i>, and <i>Warræus de Præsulibus Hibernia</i>, both noted
with my own hand. To St. John's College Library I leave all
such books, printed or MSS., as I have and are wanting
there: excepting that I leave in trust to my worthy friend,
Dr. Middleton, for the University Library, <i>Archbishop
Wake's State of the Church</i>, noted and improved under his
own hand; <i>Bp. Burnet's History of the Reformation</i>, in
three volumes, noted in my hand; and <i>Bp. Kennett's Register
and Chronicle</i> (for the memory of which three great
prelates, my honoured friends, I must always have due
regard). To these I add Mr. Ansty's, my worthy friend,
<i>History of the Garter</i>, in two vols., fol. <i>Wood's Athenæ
Oxon.</i>; and <i>Maunsell's Catalogue</i>; both noted with my own
hand&mdash;and <i>Gunton's and Patrick's History of The Church of
Peterburgh</i>, noted (from Bishop Kennett) in my hand; with
fifteen volumes (more or less) in fol., all in my own hand;
and three volumes in 4to., part in my own hand." Let us
conclude in a yet more exalted strain of christian piety
than we began. "Lastly, I constitute and appoint my dear
nephew, Richard Burton, Esq., my sole executor, to whom I
leave every thing undisposed of, which I hope will be enough
to reward his trouble. May God Almighty bless him, and give
him all the engaging qualities of his father, all the
vertues of his mother, and none of the sins or failings of
his uncle, which God knows are great and many:&mdash;and humbly,
O my God, I call for mercy! In testimony of this my will, I
have hereunto set my hand and seal, this 15th day of
October, 1739.
</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Tho. Baker.</span></p>

<p>And now, O my God, into thy hands I contentedly resign
myself: whether it be to life or death, thy will be done!
Long life I have not desired (and yet thou hast given it
me). Give me, if it be thy good pleasure, an easy and happy
death. Or if it shall please thee to visit me sorely, as my
sins have deserved, give me patience to bear thy correction,
and let me always say (even with my dying breath) Thy will
be done, Amen, Amen." Subjoined was this curious memorandum:
"At the making of this will, I have, in the corner of my
outer study, next my chamber, 170 guineas; and on the other
side of the study towards the river, 100 guineas, more or
less, in several canvass bags, behind the shelves, being
more secret and hidden, to prevent purloyning. One or more
of the shelves markt G. among the latter is a five pound
(Jacobus) piece of gold."</p>

conversing with his spirit in the library, and of getting curious
information relating to choice and precious volumes, which had escaped

have not made the most proper use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> This is drawing too severe a conclusion. But Baker merits the

more marked attention: although I am not much disposed to draw a
highly finished picture of the editor of Shakespeare.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_374_380" id="Footnote_374_380"></a><a href="#FNanchor_374_380">[374]</a> Notwithstanding Pope has called <span class="smcap">Theobald</span> by
an epithet which I have too much respect for the ears of my
readers to repeat, I do not scruple to rank the latter in
the list of bibliomaniacs. We have nothing here to do with
his edition of Shakspeare; which, by the bye, was no
despicable effort of editorial skill&mdash;as some of his notes,
yet preserved in the recent editions of our bard,
testify&mdash;but we may fairly allow Theobald to have been a
lover of Caxtonian lore, as his curious extract in <i>Mist's
Journal</i>, March 16, 1728, from our old printer's edition of
Virgil's Æneid, 1490, sufficiently testifies. While his
gothic library, composed in part of "Caxton, Wynkyn, and De
Lyra," proves that he had something of the genuine blood of
bibliomaniacism running in his veins. See Mr. Bowles's
edition of <i>Pope's Works</i>, vol. v., 114, 257.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_375_381" id="Footnote_375_381"></a><a href="#FNanchor_375_381">[375]</a> Let us, first of all, hear Hearne discourse
rapturously of the bibliomaniacal reputation of T.
Rawlinson: "In his fuit amicus noster nuperus <span class="smcap">Thomas
Rawlinsonus</span>; cujus peritiam in supellectile libraria,
animique magnitudinem, nemo fere hominum eruditorum unquam
attigit, quod tamen vix agnoscet seculum ingratum. Quanquam
non desunt, qui putent, ipsius memoriæ statuam deberi, idque
etiam ad sumptus Bibliopolarum, quorum facultates mire
auxerat; quorum tamen aliqui (utcunque de illis optime
meritus fuisset) quum librorum Rawlinsoni auctio fieret, pro
virili (clandestinò tamen) laborabant, ut minus auspicatò
venderentur. Quod videntes probi aliquot, qui rem omuem
noverant, clamitabant, ô homines scelestos! hos jam oportet
in cruciatum hinc abripi! Quod hæc notem, non est cur vitio
vertas. Nam nil pol falsi dixi, mi lector. Quo tempore vixit
Rawlinsonus (et quidem perquam jucundum est commemorare),
magna et laudabilis erat æmulatio inter viros eruditos,
aliosque etiam, in libris perquirendis ac comparandis, imo
in fragmentis quoque. Adeo ut domicilia, ubi venales id
genus res pretiosæ prostabant, hominum c&#339;tu frequenti
semper complerentur, in magnum profecto commodum eorum, ad
quos libri aliæque res illæ pertinebant; quippe quod
emptores parvo ære nunquam, aut rarissime, compararent."
<i>Walter Hemingford, præfat.</i>, p. <span class="smcap">civ.</span> In his preface to
<i>Alured de Beverly</i>, pp. v. vi., the copious stores of
Rawlinson's library, and the prompt kindness of the
possessor himself, are emphatically mentioned; while in the
preface to <i>Titi Livii Foro-Juliensis Vit. Henrici V.</i>, p.
xi., we are told, of the former, that it was "plurimis
libris rarissimis referta:" and, in truth, such a
"Bibliotheca refertissima" was perhaps never before beheld.
Rawlinson was introduced into the Tatler, under the name <span class="smcap">Tom
Folio</span>. His own house not being large enough, he hired
<i>London House</i>, in Aldersgate Street, for the reception of
his library; and there he used to regale himself with the
sight and the scent of innumerable black letter volumes,
arranged in "sable garb," and stowed perhaps "three deep,"
from the bottom to the top of his house. He died in 1725;
and catalogues of his books for sale continued, for nine
succeeding years, to meet the public eye. The following is,
perhaps, as correct a list of these copious and
heterogeneously compiled catalogues, as can be presented to
the reader. I am indebted to the library of Mr. Heber for
such a curious bibliographical morçeau. <span class="smcap">i.</span> <i>A Catalogue of

contained in the library of the above-named <span class="smcap">Thomas
Rawlinson</span>? Does he imagine that the tomes in the Bodleian,
Vatican, and British Museum were, in each single collection,
more numerous than those in the <i>Aldersgate Street</i>
repository?&mdash;Or, at any rate, would not a view of this
Aldersgate Street collection give him the completest idea of
the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of <span class="smcap">book-phrensy</span> in a private collector?
Rawlinson would have cut a very splendid figure, indeed,
with posterity, if some judicious catalogue-maker, the
Paterson of former times, had consolidated all these
straggling <i>Bibliothecal</i> corps into one compact wedge-like
phalanx. Or, in other words, if one thick octavo volume,
containing a tolerably well classed arrangement of his
library, had descended to us&mdash;oh, then we should all have
been better able to appreciate the extraordinary treasures
of <span class="smcap">such a collection</span>! The genius of Pearson and Crofts would
have done homage to the towering spirit of Rawlinson.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_376_382" id="Footnote_376_382"></a><a href="#FNanchor_376_382">[376]</a> Lysander is well warranted in borrowing the
pencil of Jan Steen, in the above bold and striking portrait
of <span class="smcap">Wanley</span>: who was, I believe, as honest a man, and as
learned a librarian, as ever sat down to morning chocolate
in velvet slippers. There is a portrait of him in oil in the
British Museum, and another similar one in the Bodleian
Library&mdash;from which latter it is evident, on the slightest
observation, that the inestimable, I ought to say immortal,
founder of the <i>Cow Pox system</i> (my ever respected and
sincere friend, Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>) had not then made known the
blessings resulting from the vaccine operation: for poor
Wanley's face is absolutely <i>peppered</i> with <i>variolous</i>
indentations! Yet he seems to have been a hale and hearty
man, in spite of the merciless inroads made upon his visage;
for his cheeks are full, his hair is cropt and curly, and
his shoulders have a breadth which shew that the unrolling
of the <span class="smcap">Harleian</span> MSS. did not produce any enervating effluvia
or <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: miasmata">mismata</span>. Our poet, Gay, in
his epistle to Pope, <i>ep.</i> 18, thus hits off his
countenance:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="poem">

And <i>visage</i>, from thy shelves, <i>with</i> dust besprent?<br />
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>But let us hear the testimony of a friend and fellow
bibliomaniac, called Thomas Hearne. The following desultory
information is translated from the preface to the <i>Annales
Prioratûs de Dunstable</i>&mdash;wherein, by the bye, there is a
good deal of pleasant information relating to Wanley. We are
here told that Wanley was "born at Coventry; and, in his
younger days, employed his leisure hours in turning over
ancient MSS., and imitating the several hands in which they
were written. Lloyd, Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry, in
one of his episcopal visitations, was the first who noticed
and patronized him. He demanded that Wanley should be
brought to him; he examined him "suis ipsius, non alterius,
oculis;" and ascertained whether what so many respectable
people had said of his talents was true or false&mdash;'A few
words with you, young man,' said the Bishop. Wanley
approached with timidity&mdash;'What are your pursuits, and where
are the ancient MSS. which you have in your possession?'
Wanley answered readily; exhibited his MSS., and entered
into a minute discussion respecting the ancient method of
painting." Hearne then expatiates feelingly upon the
excessive care and attention which Wanley devoted to ancient
MSS.; how many pieces of vellum he unrolled; and how,
sometimes, in the midst of very urgent business, he would
lose no opportunity of cultivating what was useful and
agreeable in his particular pursuit. His hobby horse seems
to have been the discovery of the ancient method of
colouring or painting&mdash;yet towards <span class="smcap">British History</span> and
<span class="smcap">Antiquities</span> he constantly cast a fond and faithful eye. How
admirably well-calculated he was for filling the situation
of librarian to Lord Oxford is abundantly evinced by his
catalogue of the Harleian MSS.; vide <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>, ante. Of his
attachment to the Bibliomania there are innumerable proofs.
Take this, <i>inter alia</i>; "I spoke to Mr. Wanley, who is not
unmindful of his promise, but says he will not trouble you
with a letter, till he has something better to present you,
which he doubts not he shall have this winter <i>among Mr.
Harley's MSS.</i> Mr. Wanley has the greatest collection of
<i>English Bibles, Psalters, &amp;c.</i>, that ever any one man had.
They cost him above 50<i>l.</i>, and he has been above twenty
years in collecting them. He would part with them, I
believe, but I know not at what price." <i>Masters's Life of
Baker</i>, p. 27. Consult also the preface to the <i>Catalogue of
the Harleian MSS.</i>, 1808, 3 vols., folio, p. 6.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">A softer noise succeeds; and the group becomes calm and attentive, as
if some grand personage were advancing. See, 'tis <span class="smcap">Harley, Earl of
Oxford</span>!<a name="FNanchor_377_383" id="FNanchor_377_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_383" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_377_383" id="Footnote_377_383"></a><a href="#FNanchor_377_383">[377]</a> There was an amusing little volume, printed
in 1782, 8vo., concerning the library of the late King of
France; and an equally interesting one might have been
composed concerning the <span class="smcap">Harleian Collection</span>&mdash;but who can now
undertake the task?&mdash;who concentrate all the rivulets which
have run from this splendid reservoir into other similar
pieces of water? The undertaking is impracticable. We have
nothing, therefore, I fear, left us but to sit down and
weep; to hang our harps upon the neighbouring willows, and
to think upon the Book "<span class="smcap">Sion</span>," with desponding sensations
that its foundations have been broken up, and its wealth
dissipated. But let us adopt a less flowery style of
communication. Before <span class="smcap">Harley</span> was created a peer, his library
was fixed at Wimple, in Cambridgeshire, the usual place of
his residence; "whence he frequently visited his friends at
Cambridge, and in particular Mr. <span class="smcap">Baker</span>, for whom he always
testified the highest regard. This nobleman's attachment to
literature, the indefatigable pains he took, and the large
sums he expended in making the above collection, are too
well known to stand in need of any further notice."
<i>Masters's life of Baker</i>, p. 107. The eulogies of Maittaire
and Hearne confirm every thing here advanced by Masters; and
the testimony of Pope himself, that Harley "left behind him
one of the finest libraries in Europe," warrants us, if
other testimonies were not even yet daily before our eyes,
to draw the same conclusion. In a periodical publication
entitled <i>The Director</i>, to which I contributed all the
intelligence under the article "<span class="smcap">Bibliographiana</span>," there
appeared the following copious, and, it is presumed, not
uninteresting, details respecting the Earl of Oxford, and
his Library. After the sale of Mr. Bridges's books, no event
occurred in the bibliographical world, worthy of notice,
till the sale of the famous <i>Harleian Library</i>, or the books
once in the possession of the celebrated <span class="smcap">Harley, Earl of
Oxford</span>. This nobleman was not less distinguished in the
political than in the literary world; and "was a remarkable
instance of the fickleness of popular opinion, and the
danger of being removed from the lower to the upper house of
parliament." (Noble's <i>Continuation of Granger</i>, vol. ii.,
23.) He was born in the year 1661, was summoned to the house
of Lords by the titles of Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, in
1711; declared minister and lord high treasurer in the same
year; resigned, and was impeached, in the year 1715;
acquitted, without being brought to a trial, in 1717; and
died at his house in Albemarle Street, in 1724. A character
so well known in the annals of this country needs no
particular illustration in the present place. The <i>Harleian
Collection of MSS.</i> was purchased by government for
10,000<i>l.</i>, and is now deposited in the British Museum (vide
<a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>, ante). The <i>Books</i> were disposed of to <span class="smcap">Thomas
Osborne</span>, of Gray's Inn, bookseller;&mdash;to the irreparable
loss, and, I had almost said, the indelible disgrace, of the
country. It is, indeed, for ever to be lamented that a
collection so extensive, so various, so magnificent, and
intrinsically valuable, should have become the property of
one who necessarily, from his situation in life, became a
purchaser, only that he might be a vender, of the volumes.
Osborne gave 13,000<i>l.</i> for the collection; a sum which must
excite the astonishment of the present age, when it is
informed that Lord Oxford gave 18,000<i>l.</i> for the <i>Binding</i>
only, of the least part of them. (From Oldys's <i>interleaved
Langbaine</i>. See Brydges's <i>Cens. Literar.</i>, vol. i., p.
438.) In the year 1743-4 appeared an account of this
collection, under the following title, <i>Catalogus
Bibliothecæ Harleianæ, &amp;c.</i>, in four volumes (the 5th not
properly appertaining to it). Dr. Johnson was employed by
Osborne to write the preface, which, says Boswell, "he has
done with an ability that cannot fail to impress all his
readers with admiration of his philological attainments."
<i>Life of Johnson</i>, vol. i., 81, edit. 4to. In my humble
apprehension, the preface is unworthy of the doctor: it
contains a few general philological reflections, expressed
in a style sufficiently stately, but is divested of
bibliographical anecdote and interesting intelligence. The
first two volumes are written in Latin by Johnson; the third
and fourth volumes, which are a repetition of the two
former, are composed in English by Oldys: and,
notwithstanding its defects, it is the best catalogue of a
large library of which we can boast. It should be in every
good collection. To the volumes was prefixed the following
advertisement: "As the curiosity of spectators, before the
sale, may produce disorder in the disposition of the books,
it is necessary to advertise the public that there will be
no admission into the library before the day of sale, which
will be on Tuesday, the 14th of February, 1744." It seems
that Osborne had charged the sum of 5<i>s.</i> to each of his
first two volumes, which was represented by the booksellers
"as an avaricious innovation;" and, in a paper published in
"<i>The Champion</i>," they, or their mercenaries, reasoned so
justly as to allege that "if Osborne could afford a very
large price for the library, he might therefore afford to
<i>give away</i> the catalogue." <i>Preface to</i> vol. iii., p. 1. To
this charge Osborne answered that his catalogue was drawn up
with great pains, and at a heavy expense; but, to obviate
all objections, "those," says he, "who have paid five
shillings a volume shall be allowed, at any time within
three months after the day of sale, either to return them in
exchange for books, or to send them back, and receive their
money." This, it must be confessed, was sufficiently
liberal. Osborne was also accused of <i>rating his books at
too high a price</i>: to this the following was his reply, or
rather Dr. Johnson's; for the style of the Doctor is
sufficiently manifest: "If, therefore, I have set a high
value upon books&mdash;if I have vainly imagined literature to be
more fashionable than it really is, or idly hoped to revive
a taste well nigh extinguished, I know not why I should be
persecuted with clamour and invective, since I shall only
suffer by my mistake, and be obliged to keep those books
which I was in hopes of selling."&mdash;<i>Preface to the 3d
volume.</i> The fact is that Osborne's charges were extremely
moderate; and the sale of the books was so very slow that
Johnson assured Boswell "there was not much gained by the
bargain." Whoever inspects Osborne's catalogue of 1748 (four
years after the Harleian sale), will find in it many of the
most valuable of Lord Oxford's books; and, among them, a
copy of the Aldine Plato of 1513, <i>struck off upon vellum</i>,
marked at 21<i>l.</i> only: for this identical copy Lord Oxford
gave 100 guineas, as Dr. Mead informed Dr. Askew; from the
latter of whose collections it was purchased by Dr. Hunter,
and is now in the Hunter Museum. There will also be found,
in Osborne's catalogues of 1748 and 1753, some of the
scarcest books in English Literature, marked at 2, or 3, or
4<i>s.</i>, for which three times the number of <i>pounds</i> is now
given.
</p>

<p class="center">ANALYSIS OF THE HARLEIAN LIBRARY.</p>

<p>I shall take the liberty of making an arrangement of the
books different from that which appears in the Harleian
catalogue; but shall scrupulously adhere to the number of
departments therein specified. And first of those in
</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Divinity.</i></p>

<p>In the <i>Greek</i>, <i>Latin</i>, <i>French</i>, and <i>Italian</i> languages,
there were about 2000 theological volumes. Among these, the
most rare and curious were Bamler's bible of 1466,
beautifully illuminated, in 2 volumes: Schæffer's bible of
1472. The famous Zurich bible of 1543, "all of which, except
a small part done by Theodoras Bibliander, was translated
from the Hebrew by a Jew, who styled himself Leo Judæ, or
the Lion of Judah. The Greek books were translated by Petrus
Cholinus. The New Testament is Erasmus's." The Scrutinium
Scripturarum of Rabbi Samuel, Mant., 1475; a book which is
said "to have been concealed by the Jews nearly 200 years:
the author of it is supposed to have lived at a period not
much later than the destruction of Jerusalem." The Islandic
bible of 1664, "not to be met with, without the utmost
difficulty, and therefore a real curiosity." The works of
Hemmerlin, Basil: 1497; "the author was ranked in the first
class of those whose works were condemned by the church of
Rome." The Mozarabic Missal printed at Toledo, in 1500&mdash;of
which some account is given at <a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>, ante. The collection
of <i>English</i> books in Divinity could not have amounted to
less than 2500 volumes. Among the rarest of these, printed
in the fifteenth century, was "The Festyvall, begynning at
the fyrst Sonday of Advent, in worship of God and all his
Sayntes," &amp;c., printed at Paris, in 1495. There was ten
books printed by Caxton, and some exceedingly curious ones
by Wynkyn de Worde and Pynson.
</p>

<p class="center">2. <i>History and Antiquities.</i></p>

<p>There appear to have been, on the whole, nearly 4000 volumes
in this department: of which, some of those relating to
Great Britain were inestimable, from the quantity of MS.
notes by Sir William Dugdale, Archbishop Parker, Thomas
Rawlinson, Thomas Baker, &amp;c. The preceding number includes
600 relating to the history and antiquities of Italy; 500 to
those of France. (This part of the catalogue deserves
particular attention, as it contains a larger collection of
pieces relating to the history of France than was, perhaps,
ever exposed to sale in this nation; here being not only the
ancient chronicles and general histories, but the memoirs of
particular men, and the genealogies of most of the families
illustrious for their antiquity. See <i>Bibl. Harl.</i>, vol.
iii., p. 159.) 150 to those of Spain; and about 250 relating
to Germany and the United Provinces.
</p>

<p class="center">3. <i>Books of Prints, Sculpture, and Drawings.</i></p>

<p>In this department, rich beyond description, there could not
have been fewer than 20,000 articles, on the smallest
computation: of which nearly 2000 were original drawings by
the great Italian and Flemish masters. The works of <span class="smcap">Callot</span>
were preserved in 4 large volumes, containing not fewer than
<i>nine hundred and twelve prints</i>. "All choice impressions,
and making the completest set of his works that are to be
seen." See <i>Bibl. Harl.</i>, vol. iii., n<span class="super">o</span>. 562, "<span class="smcap">Hollar's</span>
works, consisting of all his pieces, and bound in 12 folio
volumes, in morocco. One of the completest and best sets in
the world, both as to the number and goodness of the
impressions." Vid. <i>ibid.</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 468. It is now in the
library of the Duke of Rutland. "One hundred and
thirty-three heads of illustrious men and women, after
<span class="smcap">Vandyke</span>. This set of Vandyke's heads may be said to be the
best and completest that is to be met with any where: there
being the 12 heads which he etched himself, as likewise 79
worked off by Martin Vanden Enden: and what adds still to
the value of them is that the greater part were collected by
the celebrated Marriette at Paris, his name being signed on
the back, as warranting them good proofs."
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: The">Tne</span> engravings from <span class="smcap">Raphael's</span>
paintings, upwards of 200 in number, and by the best foreign
masters, were contained in 4 splendid morocco volumes. The
works of the <span class="smcap">Sadelers</span>, containing upwards of 959 prints, in
8 large folio volumes, were also in this magnificent
collection: and the Albert Durers, Goltziuses, Rembrandts,
&amp;c., innumerable!
</p>

<p class="center">4. <i>Collection of Portraits.</i></p>

<p>This magnificent collection, uniformly bound in 102 large
folio volumes, contained a series of heads of illustrious
and remarkable characters, to the amount of nearly 10,000 in
number. It is said, in the catalogue, to be "perhaps the
largest collection of heads ever exposed to sale." We are
also informed that it "was thought proper, for the
accommodation of the curious, to separate the volumes."
Eheu! Eheu!
</p>

<p class="center">5. <i>Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Under this head, comprehending anatomy, astronomy,
mathematics, and alchemy, there appear to have been not
fewer than 2500 volumes in the foreign languages, and about
600 in the English: some of them of the most curious kind,
and of the rarest occurrence.
</p>

<p class="center">6. <i>Geography, Chronology, and General History.</i></p>

<p>There were about 290 volumes on these subjects, written in
the Latin, French, Italian, and Spanish languages: and about
300 volumes in our own language. Some of the scarcest books
printed by Caxton were among the latter.
</p>

<p class="center">7. <i>Voyages and Histories relating to the East and West
Indies.</i></p>

<p>About 800 volumes:&mdash;nearly equally divided into the English
and foreign languages. Among the English, were Caxton's
"Recuyell of the historys of Troye," 1471 (supposed to be
the first book printed in this country;) and his "Siege and
conquest of Jherusalem," 1481.
</p>

<p class="center">8. <i>Civil, Canon, and Statute Law.</i></p>

<p>At least 800 volumes: 300 in the foreign languages, and the
remaining in English.
</p>

<p class="center">9. <i>Books of Sculpture, Architecture, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Not fewer than 900 volumes, comprehending every thing
published up to that period which was valuable or rare. Of
these, more than 700 were written in Latin, Italian, French,
or Spanish&mdash;and embellished with every beauty of graphic
illustration.
</p>

<p class="center">10. <i>Greek and Latin Classics; Grammars and Lexicons.</i></p>

<p>This very valuable body of Grecian and Roman literature
could not have included fewer than 2400 volumes&mdash;and, among
these, almost every work of rarity and excellence. In the
article of "Cicero" alone, there were 115 volumes printed in
the <i>fifteenth century</i>; every subsequent edition of that
and other authors, then distinguished for its accuracy or
erudition, may also, I believe, be discovered in the
catalogue. Most book-collectors know the sumptuous manner in
which the Harleian copies are bound.
</p>

<p class="center">11. <i>Books printed upon Vellum.</i></p>

<p>In this interesting department of typography, there were
about 220 volumes&mdash;upwards of 70 in folio, 40 in quarto, and
100 in octavo. Of the former, the most curious and rare
articles were the Mentz bible of 1462, 2 vols., and the
travels of Breydenbachus, printed at Mentz in 1486. "This
book is an uncommon object of curiosity, as it is, perhaps,
the first book of travels that was ever printed, and is
adorned with maps and pictures very remarkable. The view of
<i>Venice</i> is more than five feet long, and the map of the
<i>Holy Land</i> more than three; there are views of many other
cities. It is printed in the Gothic character." See <i>Bibl.
Harl.</i>, vol. iii., n<span class="super">o</span>. 3213. The octavos were chiefly
"Heures à l'usage," so common at the beginning of the 16th
century: but, if the catalogue be correctly published, there
appears to have been one of these books printed at Paris, as
early as the year 1466, "extremely beautiful cuts." See the
<i>Bibl. Harl.</i>, vol. iv., n<span class="super">o</span>. 18406. Now, if this were
true, it would make known a curious fact in Parisian
typography&mdash;for the usually received opinion among
bibliographers is that no printed book appeared in France
before the year 1467, when the art was first introduced at
<i>Tours</i>; and none at <i>Paris</i> before the year 1469-70&mdash;when
Crantz and Friburger were engaged to print there.
</p>

<p class="center">12. <i>English Poetry, Romances, and Novels.</i></p>

<p>There could not have been fewer than 900 volumes in this
amusing department; and among them some editions of the
rarest occurrence. Every thing printed by Caxton on these
subjects, including a complete and magnificent copy of
<i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, was in the collection&mdash;and, in respect to
other curious works, it will be sufficient to mention only
the following, as a specimen. "Kynge-Richarde Cuer du Lyon,
W. de Worde, 1528: Gascoigne's Poesies, 1575&mdash;Spenser's
Shepheardes Calenders, 1586: Webbe's Discourse of English
Poetrie, 1586: Nash's Art of English Poesie, 1589." Some of
these volumes were afterwards marked by Osborne, in his
catalogues, at 3 or 4 shillings!
</p>

<p class="center">13. <i>Livres François, Ital., et Hispan.</i></p>

<p>There might have been 700 volumes in these foreign
languages, of which nearly 500 related to <i>poetry</i>
(exclusively of others in the foregoing and following
departments).
</p>

<p class="center">14. <i>Parliamentary Affairs and Trials.</i></p>

<p>Upwards of 400 volumes.</p>

<p class="center">15. <i>Trade and Commerce.</i></p>

<p>About 300 volumes.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the preceding divisions, and from the
gradual diminution of the number of volumes in each, that I
have gone through the principal departments of the Harleian
collection of books: and yet there remain <i>fifty
departments</i> to be enumerated! These are the following: 16.
<i>Critici et Opera collecta.</i> 17. <i>Vultus et Imagines Illust.
Virorum.</i> 18. <i>Pompæ, Ceremoniæ, et Exequiæ.</i> 19. <i>De re
Militari, de Arte Equestri, et de re Navali.</i> 20.
<i>Heraldica.</i> 21. <i>Epistolæ, Panegyrici, et Orationes.</i> 22.
<i>Bibliothecarii et Miscellanei.</i> 23. <i>Tractatus Pacis et
Politici.</i> 24. <i>Traductions des Auteurs Gr. et Latin.</i> 25.
<i>Translations from Greek and Latin Authors.</i> 26. <i>Laws,
Customs, &amp;c., of the City of London.</i> 27. <i>Military, Naval
affairs, and Horsemanship.</i> 28. <i>Heraldry.</i>
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: 29.">9.</span> <i>Husbandry, Gardening,
Agriculture.</i> 30. <i>Magic, Sorcery, Witchcraft.</i> 31.
<i>Miraculous, Monstrous, and Supernatural.</i> 32. <i>Lives of
Eminent Persons.</i> 33. <i>Laws and Customs of divers Places.</i>
34. <i>Tythes, Sacrilege, and Non-residence, &amp;c.</i> 35. <i>Cases
of divers Persons.</i> 36. <i>Prisons and Prisoners.</i> 37. <i>Lives
of Murderers, Highwaymen, Pirates, &amp;c.</i> 38. <i>Speeches of
Persons executed for divers Offences.</i> 39. <i>Justices,
Juries, and Charges.</i> 40. <i>Poor, and Charitable Uses.</i> 41.
<i>Matrimony, Divorce, &amp;c.</i> 42. <i>Universities.</i> 43.
<i>Allegiance, Supremacy, Non Resistance, &amp;c.</i> 44. <i>Bank and
Bankers.</i> 45. <i>Funds, Taxes, Public Credit, Money, Coin,

Navy.</i> 48. <i>Letters on various Subjects.</i> 49. <i>Treatises of
Peace, Royal Prerogative, &amp;c.</i> 50. <i>Navigation.</i> 51.
<i>Education, Grammar and Schools.</i> 52. <i>Ludicrous,
Entertaining, Satirical, and Witty.</i> 53. <i>English
Miscellanies.</i> 54. <i>Ecclesiastical and Civil History of
Scotland.</i> 55. <i>Do. of Ireland.</i> 56. <i>Grammars and
Dictionnaries.</i> 57. <i>Plays, and relating to the Theatre.</i>
58. <i>Mathematics.</i> 59. <i>Astrology, Astronomy, and
Chymistry.</i> 60. <i>Horsemanship.</i> 61. <i>Cookery.</i> 62.
<i>Convocation.</i> 63. <i>Sieges, Battles, War, &amp;c.</i> 64. <i>Pomp and
Ceremony.</i> 65. <i>Books relating to Writing and Printing.</i> 66.
<i>Essays on various Subjects.</i> It will probably be no very
unreasonable computation to allow to each of these remaining
divisions 80 volumes: so that multiplying the whole 50
divisions by 80 there will be the additional number of 4000
volumes to make the library complete. I ought to mention
that, in my account of this extensive library, I have not
included the <i>Pamphlets</i>. Of these alone, according to Mr.
Gough (<i>Brit. Topog.</i> v., i., 669), there were computed to
be 400,000! We will now say a few words about the private
character of Lord Oxford, and conclude with a brief account
of Osborne. Every body has heard of the intimacy which
subsisted between <span class="smcap">Pope</span> and the Earl of Oxford. In the year
1721, when the latter was at his country seat, Pope sent him
a copy of Parnell's poems (of which he had undertaken the
publication on the decease of Parnell), with a letter in
poetry and prose. It seems that Pope wished to prefix his
own verses to the collection; and thus alludes to them, in
his letter to Lord Harley of the date of 1721: "Poor
Parnell, before he died, left me the charge of publishing
those few remains of his: I have a strong desire to make
them, their author, and their publisher, more considerable,
by addressing and dedicating them all to you, &amp;c. All I
shall say for it is that 'tis the only dedication I ever
writ, and shall be the only one, whether you accept it or
not: for I will not bow the knee to a less man than my Lord
Oxford, and I expect to see no greater in my time."

those we highly value. But then, how much shame did it cause
me when I read your very fine verses inclosed! My mind
reproached me how far short I came of what your great
friendship and delicate pen would partially describe me. You
ask my consent to publish it: to what straits doth this
reduce me! I look back, indeed, to those evenings I have
usefully and pleasantly spent with Mr. Pope, Mr. Parnell,
Dean Swift, the Doctor (Arbuthnot), &amp;c. I should be glad the
world knew you admitted me to your friendship; and since
your affection is too hard for your judgment, I am contented
to let the world know how well Mr. Pope can write upon a
barren subject. I return you an exact copy of the verses,
that I may keep the original, as a testimony of the only
error you have been guilty of. I hope, very speedily, to
embrace you in London, and to assure you of the particular

<p>Of <span class="smcap">Tom Osborne</span> I have in vain endeavoured to collect some
interesting biographical details. What I know of him shall
be briefly stated. He was the most celebrated bookseller of
his day; and appears, from a series of his catalogues in my
possession, to have carried on a successful trade from the
year 1738 to 1768. What fortune he amassed, is not, I
believe, very well known: his collections were truly
valuable, for they consisted of the purchased libraries of
the most eminent men of those times. In his stature he was
short and thick; and, to his inferiors, generally spoke in
an authoritative and insolent manner. "It has been
confidently related," says Boswell, "that Johnson, one day,
knocked Osborne down in his shop with a folio, and put his
foot upon his neck. The simple truth I had from Johnson
himself. 'Sir, he was impertinent to me, and I beat him. But
it was not in his shop: it was in my own chamber.'" 4to.
edit., i., 81. Of Osborne's philological attainments, the
meanest opinion must be formed, if we judge from his
advertisements, which were sometimes inserted in the London
Gazette, and drawn up in the most ridiculously vain and
ostentatious style. He used to tell the public that he
possessed "all the pompous editions of Classicks and
Lexicons." I insert the two following advertisements,
prefixed, the one to his catalogue of 1748, the other to
that of 1753, for the amusement of my bibliographical
readers, and as a model for Messrs. Payne, White, Miller,
Evans, Priestley, and Cuthell. "This catalogue being very
large, and of consequence very expensive to the proprietor,
he humbly requests that, if it falls into the hands of any
gentleman <i>gratis</i>, who chooses not himself to be a
purchaser of any of the books contained in it, that such
gentleman will be pleased to recommend it to any other whom
he thinks may be so, or to return it." To his catalogue of
1753 was the following: "To the Nobility and Gentry who
please to favour me with their commands. It is hoped, as I
intend to give no offence to any nobleman or gentleman, that
do me the honour of being my customer, by putting a price on
my catalogue, by which means they may not receive it as
usual&mdash;it is desired that such nobleman or gentleman as have
not received it, would be pleased to send for it; and it's
likewise requested of such gentleman who do receive it,
that, if they chuse not to purchase any of the books
themselves, <i>they would recommend it to any bookish
gentleman of their acquaintance, or to return it</i>, and the
favour shall be acknowledged by, their most obedient and
obliged,
</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">T. Osborne</span>."</p>

<p>I shall conclude with the following curious story told of
him, in Mr. Nichols's <i>Anecdotes of Bowyer</i> the Printer.
"Mr. David Papillon, a gentleman of fortune and literary
taste, as well as a good antiquary (who died in 1762)
contracted with Osborne to furnish him with an 100<i>l.</i> worth
of books, at <i>threepence a piece</i>. The only conditions were,
that they should be perfect, and that there should be no
duplicate. Osborne was highly pleased with his bargain, and
the first great purchase he made, he sent Mr. P. a large
quantity; but in the next purchase, he found he could send
but few, and the next, still fewer. Not willing, however, to
give up, he sent books worth <i>five shillings</i> a piece; and,
at last, was forced to go and beg to be let off the
contract. Eight thousand books would have been wanted!"&mdash;See
p. 101-2, note &#8225;&#8225;.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Let us rise to pay him homage!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Lisardo is now fairly bewitched. He believes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span> in the existence
of the group!&mdash;Help, ho! Fetters and warder for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> Philemon loves to indulge his wit at his friend's expense. Is't
not so, Lisardo?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I forgive him. 'Twas a "glorious fault." But, indeed, I would
strip to the skin, if this said nobleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span> longed for my coat,
waistcoat, small clothes, and shirt, to form him a cushion to sit
upon! I have heard such wonderful things said of his library!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> And not more wonderful than its reputation justifies. Well
might Pope be enamoured of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span> noble friend&mdash;and well might even
Dr. Mead bow to the superior splendour of such a book-competitor!
While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span> the higher order of bibliomaniacs, reposing upon satin sofas,
were quaffing burgundy out of Harley's curiously cut goblets, and
listening to the captivating tale of Mead or Folkes, respecting a
<span class="smcap">vellum</span> <i>Editio Princeps</i>&mdash;the lower order, with Bagford at their head,
were boisterously regaling themselves below, drinking ale round an
oaken table, and toasting their patron, till the eye could no longer
discover the glass, nor the tongue utter his name. Aloft, in mid air,
sat the soothed spirits of Smith and North; pointing, with their thin,
transparent fingers, to the apotheosis of <span class="smcap">Caxton</span> and <span class="smcap">Aldus</span>! Suddenly,
a crowd of pipy fragrance involves the room: these ærial forms cease
to be visible; and broken sounds, like the retiring tide beneath Dover
cliff, die away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span> into utter silence. Sleep succeeds: but short is the
slumber of enthusiastic bibliomaniacs! The watchman rouses them from
repose: and the annunciation of the hour of "two o'clock, and a
moonlight morning," reminds them of their cotton night-caps and flock
mattrasses. They start up, and sally forwards; chaunting, midst the
deserted streets, and with eyes turned sapiently towards the moon,
"Long life to the King of Book-Collectors, <span class="smcap">Harley, Earl of Oxford</span>!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> A truce, Lysander! I entreat a truce!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> To what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> To this discourse. You must be exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Indeed I agree with Lorenzo: for Lysander has surpassed, in
prolixity, the reputation of any orator within St. Stephen's chapel.
It only remains to eclipse, in a similar manner, the speeches which
were delivered at Hardy's trial&mdash;and then he may be called the
<i>Nonpareil</i> of orators!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> If you banter me, I am dumb. Nor did I know that there was any
thing of eloquence in my chit-chat. If Lisardo had had my experience,
we might <i>then</i> have witnessed some glittering exhibitions of
imagination in the book-way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> My most excellent friend, I will strive to obtain this
experience, since you are pleased to compliment me upon what I was not
conscious of possessing&mdash;But, in truth, Lysander, our obligations to
you are infinite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> No more; unless you are weary of this discourse&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> <span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Weary!?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> Let me here exercise my undeniable authority. A <i>sandwich</i>,
like the evening rain after a parching day, will recruit Lysander's
exhausted strength. What say you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> "I shall in all things obey your high command." But hark&mdash;I
hear the outer gate bell ring! The ladies are arrived: and you know my
bashfulness in female society. Adieu, <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>! 'till the morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> Nay, you are drawing too dismal conclusions. My sisters are not
sworn enemies to this kind of discourse.</p>

<p class="centertbp">
<img src="images/line03.png" width="144" height="38" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>The arrival of <span class="smcap">Almansa</span> and <span class="smcap">Belinda</span>, the sisters of Lorenzo put a stop
to the conversation. So abrupt a silence disconcerted the ladies; who,
in a sudden, but, it must be confessed, rather taunting, strain&mdash;asked
whether they should order their bed-chamber candlesticks, and retire
to rest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Not if you are disposed to listen to the most engaging
book-anecdote orator in his majesty's united realms!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Well, this may be a sufficient inducement for us to remain. But
why so suddenly silent, gentlemen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> The conversation had ceased before you arrived. We were
thinking of a <i>hung-beef sandwich</i> and a glass of madeira to recruit
Lysander's exhausted powers. He has been discoursing ever since
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belind.</span> I will be his attendant and cup-bearer too, if he promises to
resume his discourse. But you have probably dispatched the most
interesting part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Not exactly so, I would hope, fair Lady! Your brother's
hospitality will add fresh energy to my spirit; and, like the renewed
oil in an exhausted lamp, will cause the flame to break forth with
fresh splendour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belind.</span> Sir, I perceive your ingenuity, at least, has not forsaken
you&mdash;in whatever state your memory may be!&mdash;</p>

<p class="centertbp">
<img src="images/line04.png" width="142" height="37" alt="" title="" />
</p>

<p>Here the <i>sandwiches</i> made their appearance: and Lorenzo seated his
guests, with his sisters, near him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span> round a small circular table. The
repast was quickly over: and Philemon, stirring the sugar within a
goblet of hot madeira wine and water, promised them all a romantic
book-story, if the ladies would only lend a gracious ear. Such a
request was, of course, immediately complied with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> The story is short&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> And sweet, I ween.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> That remains to be proved. But listen.</p>

<p>You all know my worthy friend, <span class="smcap">Ferdinand</span>: a very <i>Helluo Librorum</i>. It
was on a warm evening in summer&mdash;about an hour after sunset&mdash;that
Ferdinand made his way towards a small inn, or rather village
alehouse, that stood on a gentle eminence, skirted by a luxuriant
wood. He entered, oppressed with heat and fatigue; but observed, on
walking up to the porch "smothered with honey-suckles" (as I think
Cowper expresses it), that every thing around bore the character of
neatness and simplicity. The holy-oaks were tall and finely variegated
in blossom: the pinks were carefully tied up: and roses of all colours
and fragrance stood around, in a compacted form, like a body-guard,
forbidding the rude foot of trespasser to intrude. Within, Ferdinand
found corresponding simplicity and comfort.</p>

<p>The "gude" man of the house was spending the evening with a neighbour;
but poached eggs and a rasher of bacon, accompanied with a flagon of
sparkling ale, gave our guest no occasion to doubt the hospitality of
the house, on account of the absence of its master. A little past ten,
after reading some dozen pages in a volume of Sir Egerton Brydges's
<i>Censura Literaria</i>, which he happened to carry about him, and
partaking pretty largely of the aforesaid eggs and ale, Ferdinand
called for his candle, and retired to repose. His bed-room was small,
but neat and airy: at one end, and almost facing the window, there was
a pretty large closet, with the door open: but Ferdinand was too
fatigued to indulge any curiosity about what it might contain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span></p>

<p>He extinguished his candle, and sank upon his bed to rest. The heat of
the evening seemed to increase. He became restless; and, throwing off
his quilt, and drawing his curtain aside, turned towards the window,
to inhale the last breeze which yet might be wafted from the
neighbouring heath. But no zephyr was stirring. On a sudden, a broad
white flash of lightning&mdash;(nothing more than summer heat) made our
bibliomaniac lay his head upon his pillow, and turn his eyes in an
opposite direction. The lightning increased&mdash;and one flash, more vivid
than the rest, illuminated the interior of the closet, and made
manifest&mdash;<i>an old mahogany Book-Case</i>, <span class="smcap">stored with books</span>. Up started
Ferdinand, and put his phosphoric treasures into action. He lit his
match, and trimmed his candle, and rushed into the closet&mdash;no longer
mindful of the heavens&mdash;which now were in a blaze with the summer
heat.</p>

<p>The book-case was guarded both with glass and brass wires&mdash;and the
key&mdash;no where to be found! Hapless man!&mdash;for, to his astonishment, he
saw <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, printed by <i>Caxton</i>&mdash;<i>Richard C&#339;ur de Lyon</i>,
by <i>W. de Worde</i>&mdash;<i>The Widow Edyth</i>, by <i>Pynson</i>&mdash;and, towering above
the rest, a <span class="smcap">large paper</span> copy of the original edition of <i>Prince's
Worthies of Devon</i>; while, lying transversely at top, reposed <i>John
Weever's Epigrams</i>, "The spirit of Captain Cox is here
revived"&mdash;exclaimed Ferdinand&mdash;while, on looking above, he saw a
curious set of old plays, with <i>Dido, Queen of Carthage</i>, at the head
of them! What should he do? No key: no chance of handling such
precious tomes&mdash;'till the morning light, with the landlord, returned!
He moved backwards and forwards with a hurried step&mdash;prepared his
pocket knife to cut out the panes of glass, and untwist the brazen
wires&mdash;but a "<i>prick of conscience</i>" made him desist from carrying his
wicked design into execution. Ferdinand then advanced towards the
window; and throwing it open, and listening to the rich notes of a
concert of nightingales, forgot the cause of his torments&mdash;'till,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span> his
situation reminding him of "<i>The Churl and the Bird</i>," he rushed with
renewed madness into the cupboard&mdash;then searched for the bell&mdash;but,
finding none, he made all sorts of strange noises. The landlady rose,
and, conceiving robbers to have broken into the stranger's room, came
and demanded the cause of the disturbance.</p>

<p>"Madam," said Ferdinand, "is there no possibility of inspecting the
<i>books</i> in the <i>cupboard</i>&mdash;where is the key?" "Alack, sir," rejoined
the landlady, "what is there that thus disturbs you in the sight of
those books? Let me shut the closet-door and take away the key of it,
and you will then sleep in peace." "Sleep in <i>peace</i>!" resumed
Ferdinand&mdash;"sleep in <i>wretchedness</i>, you mean! I can have no peace
unless you indulge me with the key of the book-case. To whom do such
gems belong?" "Sir, they are not stolen goods."&mdash;"Madam, I ask
pardon&mdash;I did not mean to question their being honest
property&mdash;but"&mdash;"Sir, they are not mine or my husband's." "Who, madam,
who is the lucky owner?" "An elderly gentleman of the name of&mdash;Sir, I
am not at liberty to mention his name&mdash;but they belong to an elderly
gentleman." "Will he part with them&mdash;where does he live? Can you
introduce me to him?"&mdash;The good woman soon answered all Ferdinand's
rapid queries, but the result was by no means satisfactory to him.</p>

<p>He learnt that these uncommonly scarce and precious volumes belonged
to an ancient gentleman, whose name was studiously concealed; but who
was in the habit of coming once or twice a week, during the autumn, to
smoke his pipe, and lounge over his books: sometimes making extracts
from them, and sometimes making observations in the margin with a
pencil. Whenever a very curious passage occurred, he would take out a
small memorandum book, and put on a pair of large tortoise-shell
spectacles, with powerful magnifying glasses, in order to insert this
passage with particular care and neatness. He usually concluded his
evening amusements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span> by sleeping in the very bed in which Ferdinand had
been lying.</p>

<p>Such intelligence only sharpened the curiosity, and increased the
restlessness, of poor Ferdinand. He retired to this said
bibliomaniacal bed, but not to repose. The morning sun-beams, which
irradiated the book-case with complete effect, shone upon his pallid
countenance and thoughtful brow. He rose at five: walked in the
meadows till seven; returned and breakfasted&mdash;stole up stairs to take
a farewell peep at his beloved <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>&mdash;sighed "three times
and more"&mdash;paid his reckoning; apologised for the night's adventure;
told the landlady he would shortly come and visit her again, and try
to pay his respects to the anonymous old gentleman. "Meanwhile," said
he, "I will leave no bookseller's shop in the neighbourhood unvisited,
'till I gain intelligence of his name and character." The landlady
eyed him steadily; took a pinch of snuff with a significant air; and,
returning, with a smile of triumph, to her kitchen, thanked her stars

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> And creditably done, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> If this be a specimen of your previous conversation, we know
not what we have lost by our absence. But I suspect, that the
principal ingredient of poetry, fiction, has a little aided in the
embellishment of your story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> This is not very gallant or complimentary on your part,
Almansa. I harbour no suspicion of its verity; for marvellous things
have been told me, by my brother, of the whimsical phrensies of
book-fanciers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> If you will only listen a little to Lysander's <i>sequel</i>, you
will hear almost equally marvellous things; which I suspect my
liberally minded sister, Almansa, will put down to the score of
poetical embellishment. But I see she is conscious of her treasonable
aspersions of the noble character of bibliomaniacs, and is only
anxious for Lysander to resume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Sir, I entreat you to finish your <span class="smcap">History of Bibliomaniacs</span>.
Your friend, Philemon, has regaled us with an entertaining episode,
and you have probably, by this time, recovered strength sufficient to
proceed with the main story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Madam, I am equally indebted to your brother for his care of
the body, and to my friend for his recreation of the mind. The
midnight hour, I fear, is swiftly approaching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> It is yet at a considerable distance. We have nearly reached
the middle of the eighteenth century, and you may surely carry on your
reminiscential exertions to the close of the same. By that time, we
may be disposed for our nightcaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Unheeded be the moments and hours which are devoted to the
celebration of eminent <span class="smcap">Book-Collectors</span>! Let the sand roll down the
glass as it will; let "the chirping on each thorn" remind us of
Aurora's saucy face peering above the horizon! in such society, and
with such a subject of discussion, who&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Lysander brightens as his story draws to a close: his colouring
will be more vivid than ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belind.</span> Tell me&mdash;are bibliographers usually thus eloquent? They have
been described to me as a dry, technical race of mortals&mdash;quoting only
title-pages and dates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Madam, believe not the malicious evidence of book-heretics.
Let ladies, like yourself and your sister, only make their appearance
with a choice set of bibliomaniacs, at this time of night, and if the
most interesting conversation be not the result&mdash;I have very much
under-rated the colloquial powers of my brethren. But you shall hear.</p>

<p class="bp">We left off with lauding the bibliomaniacal celebrity of Harley, Earl
of Oxford. Before the dispersion of his grand collection, died <span class="smcap">John
Bridges</span>,<a name="FNanchor_378_384" id="FNanchor_378_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_384" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> a gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>man, a scholar, and a notorious book-collector.
The catalogue of his books is almost the first classically arranged
one in the eighteenth century: and it must be confessed that the
collection was both curious and valuable. Bridges was succeeded by
<span class="smcap">Anthony Collins</span>,<a name="FNanchor_379_385" id="FNanchor_379_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_385" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> the Free Thinker; a character equally strange
and unenviable. Book-fanciers now and then bid a few shillings, for a
copy of the catalogue of his library; and some sly free-thinkers, of
modern date, are not backward in shewing a sympathy in their
predecessor's fame, by the readiness with which they bid a
half-guinea, or more, for a <i>priced copy</i> of it.</p>

this valuable collection of books were printed. The one was

<p><a name="Footnote_379_385" id="Footnote_379_385"></a><a href="#FNanchor_379_385">[379]</a> In the year 1730-1, there was sold by auction
at St. Paul's Coffee House, in St. Paul's Church Yard
(beginning every evening at five o'clock), the library of
the celebrated Free Thinker, <span class="smcap">Anthony Collins</span>, Esq.
"Containing a collection of several thousand volumes in
Greek, Latin, English, French, and Spanish; in divinity,
history, antiquity, philosophy, husbandry, and all polite
literature: and especially many curious travels and voyages;
and many rare and valuable pamphlets." This collection,
which is divided into <i>two parts</i> (the first containing 3451
articles, the second 3442), is well worthy of being
consulted by the theologian who is writing upon any
controverted point of divinity; as there are articles in it
of the rarest occurrence. The singular character of its
owner and of his works is well known: he was at once the
friend and the opponent of Locke and Clarke, who both were
anxious for the conversion of a character of such strong,
but misguided, talents. The former, on his death-bed, wrote
Collins a letter to be delivered to him after his decease,
which was full of affection and good advice.</p>

<p class="tbp">We may here but slightly allude to the bibliographical reputation of

his editions of the ancient Classics, at p. 442, vol. ii.,
of my <i>Introduction to the Knowledge of rare and valuable
editions of the Greek and Latin Classics</i>. He need here only
be informed that Maittaire's books were sold by auction in
November, 1748, and January, 1749; the catalogue of them
forming <i>two parts</i>, with one of these dates affixed to
each. The collection must have been uncommonly numerous; and
of their intrinsic value the reader will best judge by the
following extract from the "Advertisement," by Cock the
auctioneer, at the back of the title-page: "tho' the books,
in their present condition, make not the most ostentatious
appearance, yet, like the late worthy possessor of them,
however plain their outside may be, they contain within an
invaluable treasure of ingenuity and learning. In fine, this
is (after fifty years' diligent search and labour in
collecting) <span class="smcap">the entire library of Mr. Maittaire</span>; whose
judgement in the choice of books, as it ever was confessed,
so are they, undoubtedly, far beyond whatever I can attempt
to say in their praise. In exhibiting them thus to the
public, I comply with the will of my deceased friend; and in
printing the catalogue from his <span class="smcap">own copy</span> just as he left it
(tho' by so doing it is the more voluminous) I had an
opportunity, not only of doing the justice I owe to his
memory, but also of gratifying the curious." I incline
strongly to think there were no copies of this catalogue
printed upon large paper. When priced, the usual copy brings
a fair round sum.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_381_387" id="Footnote_381_387"></a><a href="#FNanchor_381_387">[381]</a> It is almost impossible to dwell on the
memory of <span class="smcap">this great man</span>, without emotions of
delight&mdash;whether we consider him as an eminent physician, a
friend to literature, or a collector of books, pictures, and
coins. Benevolence, magnanimity, and erudition were the
striking features of his character. His house was the
general receptacle of men of genius and talent, and of every
thing beautiful, precious, and rare. His curiosities,
whether books, or coins, or pictures, were freely laid open
to the public; and the enterprising student, and experienced
antiquary, alike found amusement and a courteous reception.
He was known to all foreigners of intellectual distinction,
and corresponded both with the artisan and the potentate.
The great patron of literature, and the leader of his
profession, it was hardly possible, as Lysander has well
observed, "for modest merit if properly introduced to him,
to depart unrewarded or ungratified." The clergy, and, in
general, all men of learning, received his advice
gratuitously; and his doors were open every morning to the
most indigent, whom he frequently assisted with money.
Although his income, from his professional practice, was
very considerable, he died by no means a rich man&mdash;so large
were the sums which he devoted to the encouragement of
literature and the fine arts! The sale of Dr. Mead's <i>Books</i>
commenced on the 18th of November, 1754, and again on the
7th of April, 1755: lasting together 57 days. The sale of
the <i>prints</i> and <i>drawings</i> continued 14 nights. The <i>gems</i>,

<p>It would be difficult to mention, within a moderate compass,
all the rare and curious articles which his library
contained&mdash;but the following are too conspicuous to be
passed over. The <i>Spira Virgil</i>, of 1470, <i>Pfintzing's

the <i>Aldine Petrarch</i>, of 1501, <span class="smcap">all upon vellum</span>. The large
paper <i>Olivet's Cicero</i> was purchased by Dr. Askew, for
14<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>, and was sold again at his sale for 36<i>l.</i>
15<i>s.</i> The King of France bought the editio princeps of

bookseller, bought the magnificently illuminated <i>Pliny by
Jenson</i>, of 1472, for 18<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i>: of which Maittaire has
said so many fine things. The <i>French</i> books, and all the
works upon the <i>Fine Arts</i>, were of the first rarity and
value, and bound in a sumptuous manner. Winstanley's

<p>Upon which his commentator, Warburton, thus observes: "These
were two eminent physicians; the one had an excellent
library, the other the finest collection in Europe of
natural curiosities." For nearly half a century did Dr. Mead
pursue an unrivalled career in his profession. He was
(perhaps "thrice") presented with the presidentship of the
College of Physicians, which he ("thrice") refused. One year
it is said he made 7000<i>l.</i>, a great sum in his time! His
regular emoluments were between 5000<i>l.</i> and 6000<i>l.</i> per
annum. He died on the 25th of February, 1754, in the 81st
year of his age. On his death, Dr. <span class="smcap">Askew</span>, who seems to have
had a sort of filial veneration for his character, and whose
pursuits were in every respect congenial with Dr. Mead's,
presented the College of Physicians with a marble bust of
him, beautifully executed by Roubilliac, and for which he
paid the sculptor 100<i>l.</i> A whimsical anecdote is connected
with the execution of this bust. Roubilliac agreed with Dr.
Askew for 50<i>l.</i>: the doctor found it so highly finished
that he paid him for it 100<i>l.</i> The sculptor said this was
not enough, and brought in a bill for 108<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> Dr.
Askew paid this demand, even to the odd shillings, and then
enclosed the receipt to Mr. Hogarth, to produce at the next
meeting of artists. Nichols's <i>Anec. of Bowyer</i>, p. 580. "I
cannot help," says Mr. Edwards, the late ornithologist,
"informing succeeding generations that they may see the
<i>real features</i> of Dr. Mead in this bust: for I, who was as
well acquainted with his face as any man living, do
pronounce this bust of him to be so like that, as often as I
see it, my mind is filled with the strongest idea of the
original." Hearne speaks of the <span class="smcap">Meadean Family</span> with proper
respect, in his <i>Alured de Beverly</i>, p. <span class="smcap">xlv.</span>; and in <i>Walter
Hemingford</i>, vol. i., <span class="smcap">xxxv.</span> In his <i>Gulielmus Nubrigensis</i>,
vol. iii., p. 744 (note), he says of our illustrious
bibliomaniac:&mdash;"that most excellent physician, and truly
great man, Dr. Richard Mead, to whom I am eternally
obliged." There is an idle story somewhere told of Dr.
Mead's declining the acceptance of a challenge to fight with
swords&mdash;alleging his want of skill in the art of fencing:
but this seems to be totally void of authority. Thus far,
concerning Dr. Mead, from the first edition of this work,
and the paper entitled "The Director." The following
particulars, which I have recently learnt of the <span class="smcap">Mead
Family</span>, from John Nicholl, Esq., my neighbour at Kensington,
and the maternal grandson of the Doctor, may be thought well
worth subjoining. <span class="smcap">Matthew Mead</span>, his father, was a clergyman.
He gave up his living at Stepney in 1662; which was
afterwards divided into the four fine livings now in the
gift of Brazen-Nose College, Oxford. His parishioners built
him a chapel; but he retired to a farm in the country, and
had the reputation of handling a bullock as well as any
butcher in the county. He went abroad in the reign of James
II., and had his sons, Samuel and Richard, educated under
Grævius. <span class="smcap">Samuel Mead</span>, <i>his brother</i>, was a distinguished
Chancery barrister, and got his 4000<i>l.</i> per ann.; his
cronies were Wilbraham and Lord Harcourt. These, with a few
other eminent barristers, used to meet at a coffee-house,
and drink their favourite, and then fashionable,
liquor&mdash;called <i>Bishop</i>, which consisted of red wine, lemon,
and sugar. Samuel was a shy character, and loved privacy. He
had a good country house, and handsome chambers in Lincoln's
Inn, and kept a carriage for his sister's use, having his
coachmaker's arms painted upon the panel. What is very
characteristic of the modesty of his profession, he
pertinaciously refused a silk gown! A word or two remains to
be said of our illustrious bibliomaniac <span class="smcap">Richard</span>. His brother
left him 30,000<i>l.</i>, and giving full indulgence to his noble
literary feelings, the Doctor sent Carte, the historian, to
France, to rummage for MSS. of <i>Thuanus</i>, and to restore the
castrated passages which were not originally published for
fear of offending certain families. He made Buckley, the
editor, procure the best <i>ink and paper</i> from Holland, for
this edition of Thuanus, which was published at his own
expense; and the Doctor was remarkably solicitous that
nothing of exterior pomp and beauty should be wanting in the
publication. The result verified his most sanguine
expectation; for a finer edition of a valuable historian has
never seen the light. Dr. Ward, says Mr. Nichols, is
supposed to have written Mead's Latin, but the fact is not
so; or it is exclusively applicable to the <i>later</i> pieces of
Mead. The Doctor died in his 83rd year (and in full
possession of his mental powers), from a fall occasioned by
the negligence of a servant. He was a great <i>diagnostic</i>
physician; and, when he thought deeply, was generally
correct in judging of the disorder by the appearance of the
countenance.</p>

booksellers of Great Britain and Ireland. Price sixpence."
This collection was an exceedingly fine one; enriched with
many books of the choicest description, which Mr. Folkes had
acquired in his travels in Italy and Germany. The works on
natural history, coins, medals, inscriptions, and on the
fine arts in general, formed the most valuable
department&mdash;those on the Greek, Latin, and English classics
were comparatively of inferior importance. It is a great
pity the catalogue was not better digested; or the books
classed according to the nature of their contents. The
following prices, for some of the more rare and interesting
articles, will amuse a bibliographer of the present day. The
chronicles of Fabian, Hall, and Grafton, did not,
altogether, bring quite 2<i>l.</i>, though the copies are
described as perfect and fair. There seems to have been a
fine set of Sir Wm. Dugdale's Works (Nos. 3074-81) in 13
vols., which, collectively, produced about 30 guineas! At
the present day, they are worth about 250<i>l.</i>&mdash;In <i>Spanish
literature</i>, the history of South America, by John Duan and
Ant. di Ulloa, Madr., fol., in 5 vols., was sold for 5<i>l.</i>:
a fine large paper copy of the description of the monastery
of St. Lorenzo, and the Escorial, Madr., 1657, brought 1<i>l.</i>
2<i>s.</i>; de Lastanosa's Spanish medals, Huesca, fol., 1645,
2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>&mdash;In <i>English</i>, the first edition of Shakspeare,
1623, which is now what a French bibliographer would say,
"presque introuvable," produced the sum of 3<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i>; and
Fuller's Worthies, 18<i>s.</i>!&mdash;&mdash;<i>Fine Arts, Antiquities, and
Voyages.</i> Sandrart's works, in 9 folio volumes (of which a
fine perfect copy is now rarely to be met with, and of very
great value) were sold for 13<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> only: Desgodetz

still higher prices: but the whole, from the present
depreciation of money, and increased rarity of the articles,
would now bring thrice the sums then given.&mdash;Of the <i>Greek
and Latin Classics</i>, the Pliny of 1469 and 1472 were sold to
Dr. Askew, for 11<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> and 7<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> At the
Doctor's sale they brought 43<i>l.</i> and 23<i>l.</i>, although the
first was lately sold (A.D. 1805) among some duplicates of
books belonging to the British Museum, at a much lower
price: the copy was, in fact, neither large nor beautiful.
Those in Lord Spencer's, and the Hunter and Cracherode
collections, are greatly superior, and would each bring more
than double the price. From a priced copy of the sale
catalogue, upon <i>large paper</i>, and uncut, in my possession,
I find that the amount of the sale, consisting of 5126
articles, was 3091<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> The <i>Prints, and Drawings</i> of
Mr. Folkes occupied a sale of 8 days: and his <i>pictures</i>,
<i>gems</i>, <i>coins</i>, and <i>mathematical instruments</i>, of five
days. Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin Folkes</span> may justly be ranked among the most
useful, as well as splendid, literary characters, of which
this country can boast. He appears to have imbibed, at a
very early age, an extreme passion for science and
literature; and to have distinguished himself so much at the
University of Cambridge, under the able tuition of Dr.
Laughton, that, in his 23rd year, he was admitted a Fellow
of the Royal Society. About two years afterwards he was
chosen one of the council; and rose in succession to the
chair of the presidentship, which, as Lysander above truly
says, he filled with a credit and celebrity that has since
never been surpassed. On this occasion he was told by Dr.
Jurin, the Secretary, who dedicated to him the 34th vol. of
the Transactions, that "the greatest man that ever lived
(Sir Isaac Newton) singled him out to fill the chair, and to
preside in the society, when he himself was so frequently
prevented by indisposition; and that it was sufficient to
say of him that he was <i>Sir Isaac's friend</i>." Within a few
years afterwards, he was elected President of the Society of
Antiquaries. Two situations, the filling of which may be
considered as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of literary distinction.
Mr. Folkes travelled abroad, with his family, about two
years and a half, visiting the cities of Rome, Florence, and
Venice&mdash;where he was noticed by almost every person of rank
and reputation, and whence he brought away many a valuable
article to enrich his own collection. He was born in the
year 1690, and died of a second stroke of the palsy, under
which he languished for three years, in 1754. He seems to
have left behind him a considerable fortune. Among his
numerous bequests was one to the Royal Society of 200<i>l.</i>,
along with a fine portrait of Lord Bacon, and a large
cornelian ring, with the arms of the society engraved upon
it, for the perpetual use of the president and his
successors in office. The MSS. of his own composition, not
being quite perfect, were, to the great loss of the learned
world, ordered by him to be destroyed. The following
wood-cut portrait is taken from a copper-plate in the
<i>Portraits des Hommes Illustres de Denmark</i>, 4to., 7 parts,
1746: part 4th, a volume which abounds with a number of
copper-plate engravings, <i>worked off</i> in a style of uncommon
clearness and brilliancy. Some of the portraits themselves
are rather stiff and unexpressive; but the vignettes are
uniformly tasteful and agreeable. The seven parts are rarely
found in an equal state of perfection.

Dr. Birch has drawn a very just and interesting character of
this eminent man, which may be found in Nichols's <i>Anecdotes
of Bowyer</i>, pp. 562-7. Mr. Edwards, the late ornithologist,
has described him in a simple, but appropriate, manner. "He
seemed," says he, "to have attained to universal knowledge;
for, in the many opportunities I have had of being in his
company, almost every part of science has happened to be the
subject of discourse, all of which he handled as an adept.
He was a man of great politeness in his manners, free from
all pedantry and pride, and, in every respect, the real,
unaffected, fine gentleman."</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Pray keep to this earth, and condescend to notice us mortals of
flesh and blood, who have heard of Dr. Mead, and Martin Folkes, only
as eminently learned and tasteful characters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I crave your forgiveness. But Dr. Mead's cabinet of coins,
statues, and books, was so liberally thrown open for the public
inspection that it was hardly possible for modest merit, if properly
made known to him, to depart unrewarded or ungratified. Nor does the
renowned President of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies&mdash;Martin
Folkes&mdash;merit a less warm eulogy; for he filled these distinguished
situations with a credit which has never since been surpassed.</p>

<p class="bp">But there is yet an illustrious tribe to be recorded. We have, first,

are better known in the University, to which he was a benefactor, than
to the noisy circles of the metropolis. The sale of <span class="smcap">Orator Henley's</span>
books "followed hard upon" that of Richard Rawlinson's; and if the
spirit of their owner could, from his "gilt tub," have witnessed the
grimaces and jokes which marked the sale&mdash;with the distorted
countenances and boisterous laughter which were to be seen on every
side&mdash;how it must have writhed under the smart of general ridicule, or
have groaned under the torture of contemptuous indignation! Peace to

<p>This valuable library must have contained nearly 25,000
volumes, multiplying the number of articles (9405) by 3&mdash;the
usual mode of calculation. Unfortunately, as was the case
with Dr. Mead's and Mr. Folkes's, the books were not
arranged according to any particular classification. Old
black-letter English were mixed with modern Italian, French,
and Latin; and novels and romances interspersed with
theology and mathematics. An <i>alphabetical</i> arrangement, be
the books of whatever kind they may, will in general obviate
the inconvenience felt from such an undigested plan; and it
were "devoutly to be wished," by all true bibliographers,
that an act of parliament should pass for the due observance
of this alphabetical order. We all know our A, B, C, but
have not all analytical heads; or we may differ in our ideas
of analysis. The scientific and alphabetical <i>united</i> is
certainly better; like Mr. Harris's excellent catalogue,
noticed at <a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>, ante. The "<i>Méthode pour dresser une
bibliothéque</i>," about which De Bure, Formey, and Peignot
have so solemnly argued, is not worth a moment's discussion.
Every man likes to be his own librarian, as well as "his own
broker." But to return to Dr. Rawlinson's collection. On
examining a priced catalogue of it, which now lies before
me, I have not found any higher sum offered for a work than
4<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> for a collection of fine prints, by Aldegrever.
(No. 9405.) The Greek and Latin Classics, of which there
were few <i>Editiones Principes</i>, or on <i>large paper</i>, brought
the usual sums given at that period. The old English
black-letter books, which were pretty thickly scattered
throughout the collection, were sold for exceedingly low
prices&mdash;if the copies were perfect. Witness the following:</p>

<p>These are only very few of the rare articles in English
literature; of the whole of which (perhaps upwards of 200 in
number) I believe the boke of St. Albans brought the highest
sum. Hence it will be seen that this was not the age of
curious research into the productions of our ancestors.
Shakspeare had not then appeared in a proper <i>variorum
edition</i>. Theobald, Pope, and Warburton, had not
investigated the <span class="bl">black-letter</span> lore of ancient English
writers for the illustration of their favourite author. This
was reserved for Capell, Farmer, Steevens, Malone, Chalmers,
Reed, and Douce: and it is expressly to these latter
gentlemen (for Johnson and Hanmer were very sparing, or very
shy, of the black-letter), that we are indebted for the
present spirit of research into the works of our ancestors.
The sale of the <i>books</i> lasted 50 days. There was a second
sale of <i>pamphlets, books of prints, &amp;c.</i>, in the following
year, which lasted 10 days: and this was immediately
succeeded by a sale of the doctor's <i>single prints and
drawings</i>, which continued 8 days. Dr. Rawlinson's
benefactions to Oxford, besides his Anglo-Saxon endowment at
St. John's College, were very considerable; including,
amongst other curiosities, <i>a series of medals of the
Popes</i>, which the Doctor supposed to be one of the most
complete collections in Europe; and a great number of
valuable MSS., which he directed to be safely locked up, and
not to be opened till seven years after his decease. He died
on the 6th of April, 1755. To St. John's College, where he
had been a gentleman commoner, Dr. Rawlinson left the bulk
of his estate, amounting to near 700<i>l.</i> a year: <i>a plate of
Abp. Laud</i>, 31 volumes of <i>Parliamentary Journals and
Debates</i>, a set of <i>Rymer's F&#339;dera</i>, his <i>Greek</i>,
<i>Roman</i>, and <i>English coins</i>, not given to the Bodleian
Library; all his plates engraved at the expense of the
Society of Antiquaries; his diploma, and his <i>heart</i>; which
latter is placed in a beautiful urn against the chapel wall,
with this inscription:</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_384_390" id="Footnote_384_390"></a><a href="#FNanchor_384_390">[384]</a> This gentleman's library, not so remarkable
for the black-letter as for whimsical publications, was sold
by auction, by Samuel Paterson (the earliest sale in which I
find this well known book-auctioneer engaged), in June,
1759, and the three ensuing evenings. The title of the Sale
Catalogue is as follows:&mdash;&mdash;"<i>A Catalogue of the original
MSS. and manuscript collections of the late</i> Reverend Mr.
<span class="smcap">John Henley</span>, A.M., Independent Minister of the Oratory, &amp;c.,
in which are included sundry collections of the late Mons.
des Maizeaux, the learned editor of Bayle, &amp;c., Mr. Lowndes,
author of the Report for the Amendment of Silver coins, &amp;c.,
Dr. Patrick Blair, Physician at Boston, and F.R.S., &amp;c.
Together with original letters and papers of State,
addressed to Henry d'Avenant, Esq., her Britannic Majesty's
Envoy at Francfort, from 1703 to 1708 inclusive." Few
libraries have contained more curious and remarkable
publications than did this. The following articles, given as
notable specimens, remind us somewhat of Addison's memoranda
for the Spectator, which the waiter at the coffee-house
picked up and read aloud for the amusement of the
company.&mdash;&mdash;No. 166. God's Manifestation by a Star to the
Dutch. A mortifying Fast-Diet at Court. On the Birth Day of
the first and oldest young Gentleman. All corrupt: none
good; no, not one.&mdash;&mdash;168. General Thumbissimo. The Spring
reversed, or the Flanderkin's Opera and Dutch Pickle
Herrings. The Creolean Fillip, or Royal Mishap. A Martial
Telescope, &amp;c. England's Passion Sunday, and April
Changelings.&mdash;&mdash;170. Speech upon Speech. A Telescope for
Tournay. No Battle, but worse, and the True Meaning of it.
An Army beaten and interred.&mdash;&mdash;174. Signs when the P. will
come. Was Captain Sw-n, a Prisoner on Parole, to be

Masters, and Magistrates, that do not punish the Sin at
Stokesley. A Speech, &amp;c. A Parallel between the Rebels to K.

killing at <i>Falkirk</i>.&mdash;&mdash;179. Let Stocks be knighted, write,
Sir Bank, &amp;c., the Ramhead Month. A Proof that the Writers
against Popery, fear it will be established in this Kingdom.
A Scheme wisely blabbed to root and branch the Highlanders.
Let St. Patrick have fair Play, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;Of <span class="smcap">Orator Henley</span> I
have not been able to collect any biographical details, more
interesting than those which are to be found in Warburton's
notes to Pope's Dunciad: He was born at Melton Mowbray, in
Leicestershire, in 1692, and was brought up at St. John's
College, in the University of Cambridge. After entering into
orders, he became a preacher in London, and established a
lecture on Sunday evenings, near Lincoln's-Inn Fields, and
another on Wednesday evenings, chiefly on political and
scientific subjects. Each auditor paid one shilling for
admission. "He declaimed," says Warburton, "against the
greatest persons, and occasionally did our poet (Pope) that
honour. When he was at Cambridge, he began to be uneasy; for
it shocked him to find he was commanded to believe against
his own judgment in points of religion, philosophy, &amp;c.: for
his genius leading him freely to <i>dispute all propositions</i>,
and <i>call all points to account</i>, he was impatient under
those fetters of the free-born mind." When he was admitted
into priest's orders, he thought the examination so short
and superficial that he considered it "<i>not necessary to
conform to the Christian religion</i>, in order either to be a
deacon or priest." With these quixotic sentiments he came to
town; and "after having, for some years, been a writer for
the booksellers, he had an ambition to be so for ministers
of state." The only reason he did not rise in the church, we
are told, "was the envy of others, and a disrelish
entertained of him, because <i>he was not qualified to be a
complete spaniel</i>." However, he offered the service of his
pen to two great men, of opinions and interests directly
opposite: but being rejected by both of them, he set up a
new project, and styled himself, "<i>The restorer of ancient
eloquence.</i>" Henley's pulpit, in which he preached, "was
covered with velvet, and adorned with gold." It is to this
that Pope alludes, in the first couplet of his second book
of the Dunciad:</p>

<p>"He had also an altar, and placed over it this extraordinary
inscription, '<i>The primitive Eucharist.</i>'" We are told by
his friend Welsted (narrative in Oratory Transact. N<span class="super">o</span>. 1)
that "he had the assurance to form a plan, which no mortal
<i>ever thought of</i>; he had success against all opposition;
challenged his adversaries to fair disputations, and <i>none
would dispute with him</i>: he wrote, read, and studied, twelve
hours a day; composed three dissertations a week on all
subjects; undertook to teach in <i>one year</i> what schools and
universities teach in <i>five</i>: was not terrified by menaces,
insults, or satires; but still proceeded, matured his bold
scheme, and put the church and <i>all that in danger</i>!" See
note to Dunciad, book iii., v. 199. Pope has described this
extraordinary character with singular felicity of
expression:</p>

<p>Bromley, in his catalogue of engraved Portraits, mentions
<i>four</i> of orator Henley: two of which are inscribed, one by
Worlidge "The Orator of Newport Market;" another (without
engraver's name) "A Rationalist." There is a floating story
which I have heard of Henley. He gave out that he would shew
a new and expeditious method of converting a pair of boots
into shoes. A great concourse of people attended, expecting
to see something very marvellous; when Henley mounted his
"tub," and, holding up a boot, he took a knife, and <i>cut

which was disposed of, by auction, in the same year (1764)
in which Genl. Dormer's was sold. Hutton's library consisted
almost entirely of <i>English Literature</i>: the rarest books in
which are printed in the italic type. When the reader is
informed that "<i>Robinsons Life, Actes, and Death of Prince
Arthur</i>," and his "<i>ancient order, societie, and unitie,
laudable of the same</i>," 1583, 4to. (see n<span class="super">o</span>. 2730;

discoursed so accurately and copiously: <i>British

that this produced only 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;that

rare and precious black letter gems were sold, collectively,
for only 2<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>!&mdash;what must be his reproaches
upon the lack of spirit which was evinced at this sale!
Especially must his heart melt within him, upon looking at
the produce of some of these articles at the sale of George
Steevens' books, only 36 years afterwards! No depreciation
of money can account for this woful difference. I possess a
wretchedly priced copy of the <i>Bibl. Huttoniana</i>, which I
purchased, without title-page or a decent cover, at the sale
of Mr. Gough's books, for 11<i>s.</i> Lysander ought also to have
noticed in its chronological order, the extensive and truly
valuable library of <span class="smcap">Robert Hoblyn</span>; the catalogue of which
was published in the year 1769, 8vo., in two parts: pp. 650.
I know not who was the author of the arrangement of this
collection; but I am pretty confident that the judicious
observer will find it greatly superior to every thing of its
kind, with hardly even the exception of the <i>Bibliotheca
Croftsiana</i>. It is accurately and handsomely executed, and
wants only an index to make it truly valuable. The
collection, moreover, is a very sensible one. My copy is
upon <i>large paper</i>; which is rather common.</p>

catalogue we are told that the books were "in general of the
best editions, and in the finest condition, many of them in
<i>large paper</i>, bound in morocco, gilt leaves," &amp;c. This was
a very choice collection of books; consisting almost
entirely of French, Greek, Latin, Italian, and Spanish. The
number of articles did not exceed 3082; and of volumes,
probably not 7000. The catalogue is neatly printed, and
copies of it on <i>large paper</i> are exceedingly scarce. Among
the most curious and valuable articles are the
following:&mdash;&mdash;n<span class="super">o</span>. 599. Les Glorieuses Conquestes de Louis
le Grand, par Pontault, <i>en maroquin</i>. Paris, 1678. ("<i>N.B.
In this copy many very fine and rare portraits are added,
engraved by the most eminent masters.</i>")&mdash;&mdash;n<span class="super">o</span>. 604.
Recueil des Maisons Royales, fort bien gravés par Sylvestre,
&amp;c. (N.B. In the book was the following note. "<i>Ce recueil
des Maisons Royales n'est pas seulement complet, en toutes
manières, mais on y a ajouté plusieurs plans, que l'on ne
trouvent que très rarement.</i>")&mdash;&mdash;n<span class="super">o</span>. 731. Fabian's
Chronicle, 1559.&mdash;&mdash;752, Hall's ditto. 1548.&mdash;&mdash;751.
Higden's Polychronicon. 1527. (I suspect that Dr. Askew
purchased the large paper Hutchinson's Xenophon, and
Hudson's Thucydides. n<span class="super">os</span>. 2246, 2585.)&mdash;&mdash;n<span class="super">o</span>. 2249.
Don Quixote, por Cervantes. Madr., 4to., 1605. In hoc libro
hæc nota est. "<i>Cecy est l'edition originale; il y a une
autre du mesme année, imprimée en quarto à Madrid, mais
imprimée apres cecy. J'ay veu l'autre, et je les ay comparez
avec deux autres editions du mesme année, 1605; une imprimée
à Lisbonne, en 4to., l'autre en Valentia, en</i>
8vo."&mdash;&mdash;n<span class="super">o</span>. 2590. Thuanus by Buckley, on <i>large paper</i>,
in 14 volumes, folio; a magnificent copy, illustrated with
many beautiful and rare portraits of eminent characters,
mentioned by De Thou. (N.B. This very copy was recently sold
for 74<i>l.</i>)&mdash;&mdash;From n<span class="super">o</span>. 2680 to the end of the Catalogue
(401 articles) there appears a choice collection of Italian

Ireland; their early navigators, discoverers, and improvers,
and the <i>ancient English literature</i>: of which there are a
great number of uncommon books and tracts, elucidated by MS.

portraits and devices, rarely to be found: including the
works of Caxton, Lettou, Machlinia, the anonymous St. Albans

<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<p>"The following catalogue exhibits a very curious and
uncommon collection of printed books and tracts. Of British
History and Antiquities, and of <i>Rare Old English
Literature</i>, the most copious of any which has appeared for
several years past; formed with great taste, and a thorough
knowledge of authors and characters, by that judicious
critic and able antiquary the late <span class="smcap">James West</span>, Esq.,
President of the Royal Society. Several anonymous writers
are herein brought to light&mdash;many works enlarged and further
explained by their respective authors and editors&mdash;and a far
greater number illustrated with the MS. notes and
observations of some of our most respectable antiquaries:
among whom will be found the revered names of Camden,
Selden, Spelman, Somner, Dugdale, Gibson, Tanner, Nicolson,
Gale, Le Neve, Hearne, Anstis, Lewis, St. Amand, Ames,
Browne, Willis, Stukely, Mr. West, &amp;c. But, above all, the
intense application and unwearied diligence of the admirable
Bishop White Kennett, upon the ecclesiastical, monastical,
constitutional, and topographical history of Great Britain,
so apparent throughout this collection, furnish matter even
to astonishment; and are alone sufficient to establish the
reputation, and to perpetuate the memory, of this
illustrious prelate, without any other monuments of his
greatness." "In an age of general inquiry, like the present,
when studies less interesting give place to the most
laudable curiosity and thirst after investigating every
particular relative to the history and literature of our own
country, nothing less than an elaborate digest of this
valuable library could be expected; and, as a supplement to
the history of English literature, more desired." "That task
the Editor has cheerfully undertaken: and, he flatters
himself, executed as well as the short time allowed would
permit. He further hopes, to the satisfaction of such who
are capable of judging of its utility and importance." "The
lovers of engraved English portraits (a species of modern
connoisseurship which appears to have been first started by
the late noble Earl of Oxford, afterwards taken up by Mr.
West, Mr. Nicolls, editor of Cromwell's State-Papers, Mr.
Ames, &amp;c., and since perfected by the Muse of
Strawberry-Hill, the Rev. Wm. Granger, and some few more
ingenious collectors) may here look to find a considerable
number of singular and scarce heads, and will not be
disappointed in their search." Thus much Paterson; who, it
must be confessed, has promised more than he has performed:
for the catalogue, notwithstanding it was the <i>second</i> which
was published (the first being by a different hand, and most
barbarously compiled) might have exhibited better method and
taste in its execution. Never were rare and magnificent
books more huddled together and smothered, as it were, than
in this catalogue. Let us now proceed to an analysis of Mr.
West's Collection.</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Volumes of Miscellaneous Tracts.</i></p>

<p>These volumes extend from n<span class="super">o</span>. 148 to 200, from 915 to
992, from 1201 to 1330, and from n<span class="super">o</span>. 1401 to 1480.&mdash;Among
them are some singularly choice and curious articles. The
following is but an imperfect specimen.</p>

<p>The preceding affords but a very inadequate idea of the
"pithie, pleasant, and profitable" discourses mid tracts
which abounded among the miscellaneous articles of Mr.
West's library. Whatever be the defects of modern
literature, it must be allowed that we are not <i>quite so
coarse</i> in the <i>title pages</i> of our books.
</p>

<p class="center">2. <i>Divinity.</i></p>

<p>This comprehended a vast mass of information, under the
following general title. Scarce Tracts: Old and New
Testaments (including almost all the first English editions
of the New Testament, which are now of the rarest
occurrence): Commentators: Ecclesiastical History: Polemics:
Devotions, Catholic and Calvinistical: Enthusiasm:
Monastical History: Lives of Saints: Fathers: Missionaries:
Martyrs: Modern Divines and Persons of eminent piety: Free
Thinkers: Old English Primers: Meditations: Some of the
earliest Popish and Puritanical Controversy: Sermons by old
English Divines, &amp;c. In the whole 560 articles: probably
about 1200 volumes. These general heads are sufficient to
satisfy the bibliographer that, with such an indefatigable
collector as was Mr. West, the greater part of the
theological books must have been extremely rare and curious.
From so <i>many Caxtons</i>, <i>Wynkyn de Wordes</i>, <i>Pynsons, &amp;c.</i>,
it would be difficult to select a <i>few</i> which should give a
specimen of the value of the rest. Suffice it to observe
that such a cluster of <i>Black Letter Gems</i>, in this
department of English literature, has never since been seen
in any sale catalogue.
</p>

<p class="center">3. <i>Education, Languages, Criticism, Classics, Dictionaries,
Catalogues of Libraries, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>There were about 700 volumes in these departments. The
catalogues of English books, from that of Maunsell in 1595,
to the latest before Mr. West's time, were nearly complete.
The treatises on education, and translations of the ancient
classics, comprehended a curious and uncommon collection.
The Greek and Latin Classics were rather select than rare.
</p>

<p class="center">4. <i>English Poetry, Romances, and Miscellanies.</i></p>

<p>This interesting part of the collection comprehended about
355 articles, or probably about 750 volumes: and, if the
singularly rare and curious books which may be found <i>under
these heads alone</i> were now to be concentrated in one
library, the owner of them might safely demand 4000 guineas
for such a treasure! I make no doubt but that his <span class="smcap">Majesty</span> is
the fortunate possessor of the greater number of articles
under all the foregoing heads.
</p>

<p class="center">5. <i>Philosophy, Mathematics, Inventions, Agriculture, and
Horticulture, Medicine, Cookery, Surgery, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Two hundred and forty articles, or about 560 volumes.</p>

<p class="center">6. <i>Chemistry, Natural History, Astrology, Sorcery,
Gigantology.</i></p>

<p>Probably not more than 100 volumes. The word "Gigantology,"
first introduced by Mr. Paterson, I believe, into the
English language, was used by the French more than two
centuries ago. See n<span class="super">o</span>. 2198 in the catalogue.
</p>

<p class="center">7. <i>History and Antiquities.</i></p>

<p>This comprehended a great number of curious and valuable
productions, relating both to foreign and domestic
transactions.</p>

<p class="center">8. <i>Heraldry and Genealogy.</i></p>

<p>An equal number of curious and scarce articles may be found
under these heads.</p>

<p class="center">9. <i>Antient Legends and Chronicles.</i></p>

<p>To the English antiquary, few departments of literature are
more interesting than this. Mr. West seems to have paid
particular attention to it, and to have enriched his library
with many articles of this description of the rarest
occurrence. The lovers of Caxton, Fabian, Hardyng, Hall,
Grafton, and Holinshed, may be highly gratified by
inspecting the various editions of these old chroniclers. I
entreat the diligent bibliographer to examine the first 8
articles of page 209 of the catalogue. Alas! when will such
gems again glitter at one sale? The fortunate period for
collectors is gone by: a knowledge of books almost every
where prevails. At York, at Exeter, at Manchester, and at
Bristol, as well as in London, this knowledge may be found
sometimes on the dusty stall, as well as in the splendid
shop. The worth of books begins to be considered by a
different standard from that of the quantity of gold on the
exterior! We are now for "<i>drinking deep</i>," as well as
"<i>tasting</i>!" But I crave pardon for this digression, and
lose sight of Mr. West's <i>uniques</i>.</p>

<p class="center">10. <i>Topography.</i></p>

<p>Even to a veteran like the late Mr. Gough, such a collection
as may be found from p. 217 to 239 of the catalogue, would
be considered a very first-rate acquisition. I am aware that
the Gothic wainscot and stained glass windows of <i>Enfield
Study</i> enshrined a still more exquisite topographical
collection! But we are improved since the days of Mr. West;
and every body knows to <i>whom</i> these improvements are, in a
great measure, to be attributed! When I call to mind the
author of "<i>British Topography</i>" and "<i>Sepulchral
Monuments</i>," I am not insensible to the taste, diligence,
and erudition of the "par nobile fratrum," who have
gratified us with the "<i>Environs of London</i>," and the three
volumes of "<i>Magna Britannia</i>!" Catalogues of Mr. West's
library, with the sums for which the books were sold, are
now found with difficulty, and bring a considerable price.
The late Mr. G. Baker, who had a surprisingly curious
collection of priced catalogues, was in possession of the
<i>original sale</i> one of West's library. It is interleaved,
and, of course, has the prices and names of the purchasers.
Mr. Heber has also a priced copy, with the names, which was
executed by my industrious and accurate predecessor, William
Herbert, of typographico-antiquarian renown. The number of
articles, on the whole, was 4653; and of the volumes as many
articles were single, probably about 8000. <i>Ample</i> as some
"pithy" reader may imagine the foregoing analysis to be, I
cannot find it in my heart to suffer such a collection, as
was the <i>Bibliotheca Westiana</i>, to be here dismissed in so
<i>summary</i> a manner. Take, therefore, "pleasaunt" reader, the
following account of the <i>prices</i> for which some of the
aforesaid book-gems were sold. They are presented to thee as
a matter of curiosity only; and not as a criterion of their
present value. And as <span class="smcap">Master Caxton</span> has of late become so
popular amongst us, we will see, inter alios, what some of
the books printed by so "simple a person" produced at this
renowned sale.</p>

<p>But why should I go on tantalising the S&mdash;&mdash;s, H&mdash;&mdash;s,
S&mdash;&mdash;s, R&mdash;&mdash;s, and U&mdash;&mdash;s, of the day, by further specimens
of the <i>enormous</i> sums here given for such <i>common</i> editions
of old <span class="smcap">Romances</span>? Mr. George Nicol, his majesty's bookseller,
told me, with his usual pleasantry and point, that he got
abused in the public papers, by Almon and others, for his having purchased nearly the whole of the Caxtonian volumes
in this collection for his Majesty's library. It was said
abroad that "a Scotchman had lavished away the king's money
in buying old black-letter books." A pretty specimen of
<i>lavishing</i> away royal money, truly! There is also another
thing, connected with these <i>invaluable</i> (I speak as a
bibliomaniac&mdash;and, perhaps, as a metaphysician may think&mdash;as
a fool! but let it pass!) with these invaluable
purchases:&mdash;his Majesty, in his directions to Mr. Nicol,
forbade any competition with those purchasers who wanted
books of science and belles-lettres for their <i>own
professional</i> or <i>literary</i> pursuits: thus using, I ween,
the powers of his purse in a manner at once merciful and
wise.&mdash;"O si sic"&mdash;may we say to many a heavy-metalled
book-auction bibliomaniac of the present day!&mdash;Old Tom
Payne, the father of the respectable Mr. Payne, of
Pall-Mall, used to tell Mr. Nichol&mdash;<i>pendente hastâ</i>&mdash;that
he had been "raising all the <span class="smcap">Caxtons</span>!" "Many a copy," quoth
he, "hath <i>stuck</i> in my shop at two guineas!" Mr. <span class="smcap">Nichols</span>,
in his amusing biography of Bowyer, has not devoted so large
a portion of his pages to the description of Mr. West's
collection, life, and character, as he has to many
collectors who have been less eminently distinguished in the
bibliographical world. Whether this was the result of the
paucity, or incongruity, of his materials, or whether, from
feelings of delicacy he might not choose to declare all he
knew, are points into which I have neither right nor
inclination to enquire. There seems every reason to conclude
that, from youth, West had an elegant and well-directed
taste in matters of literature and the fine arts. As early
as the year 1720, he shewed the munificence of his
disposition, in these respects, by befriending Hearne with a
plate for his <i>Antiquities of Glastonbury</i>; see p.
285&mdash;which was executed, says Hearne, "Sumptibus ornatissimi
amicissimique Juvenis (multis sane nominibus de studiis
nostris optime meriti) <span class="smcap">Jacobi West</span>," &amp;c. So in his pref. to
<i>Adam de Domerham de reb. gest. Glaston</i>:&mdash;"antiquitatum ac
historiarum nostrarum studiosus in primis&mdash;Jacobus West." p.
xx. And in his <i>Walter Hemingford</i>, we have:&mdash;"fragmentum,
ad civitatem Oxoniensem pertinens, admodum egregium, mihi
dono dedit amicus eximius Jacobus West&mdash;is quem alibi
juvenem ornatissimum appellavi," &amp;c., p. 428. How the
promise of an abundant harvest, in the mature years of so
excellent a young man, was realized, the celebrity of West,
throughout Europe, to his dying day, is a sufficient
demonstration. I conclude with the following; which is
literally from Nichols's <i>Anecdotes of Bowyer</i>. "James West,
of Alscott, in the county of Warwick, Esq., M.A., of Baliol
College, Oxford, (son of Richard West, said to be descended,
according to family tradition, from Leonard, a younger son
of Thomas West, Lord Delawar, who died in 1525) was
representative in parliament for St. Alban's, in 1741; and
being appointed one of the joint Secretaries of the
Treasury, held that office till 1762. In 1765 or 1766, his
old patron the Duke of Newcastle, obtained for him a pension
of 2000<i>l.</i> a year. He was an early member, and one of the
Vice Presidents, of the Antiquary Society; and was first
Treasurer, and afterwards President, of the Royal Society.
He married the daughter and heiress of Sir Thomas Stephens,
timber merchant, in Southwark, with whom he had a large
fortune in houses in Rotherhithe; and by whom he had a son,
James West, Esq., now (1782) of Alscott, one of the Auditors
of the Land-Tax, and sometime Member of Parliament for
Boroughbridge, in Yorkshire (who in 1774 married the
daughter of Christopher Wren, of Wroxhall in Warwickshire,
Esq.), and had two daughters. Mr. West died in July, 1772.
His large and valuable collection of <span class="smcap">Manuscripts</span> was sold to
the <i>Earl of Shelburne</i>, and is now deposited in the British
Museum."</p>

collector of the <i>Bibliotheca Westiana</i> than myself. Hark&mdash;! or is it
only a soft murmur from a congregation of autumnal zephyrs!&mdash;but
methought I heard a sound, as if calling upon us to look well to the
future fate of our libraries&mdash;to look well to their being <i>creditably
catalogued</i>&mdash;"For" (and indeed it <i>is</i> the voice of West's spirit that
speaks) "my collection was barbarously murdered; and hence I am doomed
to wander for a century, to give warning to the &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, and &mdash;&mdash;,
of the day, to execute this useful task with their own hands! Yes;
even the name of <span class="smcap">Paterson</span> has not saved my collection from censure;
but his hands were then young and inexperienced&mdash;yet I suffer from
this innocent error!" Away, away, vexed spirit&mdash;and let thy head rest
in peace beneath the sod!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> For heaven's sake, into what society are we introduced, sister?
All mad&mdash;book mad! but I hope harmless.</p>

energies of the lion, we have the gentleness of the "unweaned lamb."
But, in describing so many and such discordant characters, how can I
proceed in the jog-trot way of&mdash;"next comes such a one&mdash;and then
follows another&mdash;and afterwards proceeds a third, and now a fourth!?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Sir, you are right, and I solicit your forgiveness. If I have
not sufficient bookish enthusiasm to fall down and worship your
<span class="smcap">Caxtonian Deity</span>, <span class="smcap">James West</span>, I am at least fully disposed to concede
him every excellent and amiable quality which sheds lustre upon a
literary character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> All offence is expiated: for look, the spirit walks off
calmly&mdash;and seems to acknowledge, with satisfaction, such proper
sentiments in the breast of one whose father and brother have been
benefited by his book treasures.</p>

<p class="bp">The rapturous, and, I fear you will think, the wild and incoherent,
manner in which I have noticed the sale of the <i>Bibliotheca Westiana</i>
had nearly driven from my recollection that, in the preceding, the
same, and subsequent, year, there was sold by auction a very curious
and extraordinary collection of books and Prints belonging to honest
<span class="smcap">Tom Martin</span>,<a name="FNanchor_389_395" id="FNanchor_389_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_395" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> <i>of Palgrave</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span> in Suffolk: a collector of whom, if I
remember rightly, Herbert has, upon several occasions, spoken with a
sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span> of veneration. If Lavater's system of physiognomy happen to
receive your approbation, you will conclude, upon contemplating Tom's
frank countenance&mdash;of which a cut precedes the title-page of the first
catalogue&mdash;that the collector of Palgrave must have been "a fine old
fellow." Martin's book-pursuits were miscellaneous, and perhaps a
little too wildly followed up; yet some good fortune contributed to
furnish his collection with volumes of singular curiosity.</p>

<p class="tbp">But I proceed. The commotions excited in the book world, by means of

however, only add that there were upwards of 150 articles of

difficult to pitch upon the rarest volumes. The collection,

and how kindly (as I remember to have heard one of his intimate

the curious <i>manuscript</i>, decipher the half effaced characters&mdash;and
then, casting an eye of ecstacy over the shelves upon which similar
treasures were lodged, exult in the glorious prospect before him! But

renowned Doctor&mdash;when Askew, with all his skill in medicine and

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_391_397" id="Footnote_391_397"></a><a href="#FNanchor_391_397">[391]</a> Lysander is now arrived, pursuing his
chronological order, at a very important period in the
annals of book-sales. The name and collection of Dr. <span class="smcap">Askew</span>
are so well known in the bibliographical world that the
reader need not be detained with laboured commendations on
either: in the present place, however, it would be a cruel
disappointment not to say a word or two by way of preface or
prologue. Dr. <span class="smcap">Anthony Askew</span> had eminently distinguished
himself by a refined taste, a sound knowledge, and an
indefatigable research, relating to every thing connected
with Grecian and Roman literature. It was to be expected,
even during his life, as he was possessed of sufficient
means to gratify himself with what was rare, curious, and
beautiful, in literature and the fine arts, that the public
would one day be benefited by such pursuits: especially as
he had expressed a wish that his treasures might be
unreservedly submitted to sale, after his decease. In this
wish the doctor was not singular. Many eminent collectors
had indulged it before him: and, to my knowledge, many
modern ones still indulge it. Accordingly, on the death of
Dr. Askew, in 1774, appeared, in the ensuing year, a
catalogue of his books for sale, by Messrs. Baker and Leigh,
under the following title: "<span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Askeviana</span>, <i>sive
Catalogus Librorum Rarissimorum Antonii Askew, M.D., quorum
Auctio fiet apud S. Baker et G. Leigh, in Vico dicto York
Street, Covent Garden, Londini, Die Lunæ, 13 Februarii</i>,
<span class="smcap">mdcclxxv</span>, <i>et in undeviginti sequentes dies</i>." A few copies
were struck off on <i>large paper</i>, which are yet rather
common. My own copy is of this kind, with the prices, and
names of the purchasers. We are told, by the compiler of the
catalogue, that it was thought "unnecessary to say much with
respect to this library of the late Dr. Anthony Askew, as
the collector and the collection were so well known in
almost all parts of Europe." Afterwards it is observed that
"The books in general are in very fine condition, many of
them bound in morocco, and russia leather, with gilt
leaves." "To give a particular account," continues the
compiler, "of the <i>many scarce editions</i> of books in this
catalogue would be almost endless, therefore the <i>first
editions</i> of the classics, and some <i>extremely rare books</i>,
are chiefly noticed. The catalogue, without any doubt,
contains the best, rarest, and most valuable collection of
<span class="smcap">Greek</span> and <span class="smcap">Latin Books</span> that was ever sold in England, and the
great time and trouble of forming it will, it is hoped, be a
sufficient excuse for the price put to it." (1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> the
small paper, and 4<i>s.</i> the large.) This account is not
overcharged. The collection in regard to Greek and Roman
literature was <i>unique</i> in its day. Enriched with many a
tome from the Harleian, Dr. Mead's, Martin Folkes's, and Dr.
Rawlinson's library, as well as with numerous rare and
splendid articles from foreign collections (for few men
travelled with greater ardour, or had an acuter
discrimination than Dr. Askew), the books were sought after
by almost every one then eminent for bibliographical
research. <span class="smcap">His Majesty</span> was a purchaser, says Mr. J. Nichols,
to the amount of about 300<i>l.</i>; Dr. Hunter, to the amount of
500<i>l.</i>; and De Bure (who had commissions from the King of
France and many foreign collectors, to the amount of
1500<i>l.</i>) made purchases to the same amount; Dr. Maty was
solicited by the trustees of the British Museum not to be
unmindful of <i>that repository</i>; and accordingly he became a
purchaser to a considerable amount. The late worthy and
learned Mr. M. <span class="smcap">Cracherode</span>, whose library now forms one of
the most splendid acquisitions of the British Museum, and
whose <i>bequest</i> of it will immortalize his memory, was also
among the "Emptores literarii" at this renowned sale. He had
enriched his collection with many an "<i>Exemplar
Askevianum</i>;" and, in his latter days, used to elevate his
hands and eyes, and exclaim against the prices <i>now</i> offered
for <span class="smcap">Editiones Principes</span>. The fact is, Dr. Askew's sale has
been considered a sort of <i>era</i> in bibliography. Since that
period, rare and curious books in Greek and Latin literature
have been greedily sought after, and obtained (as a recent
sale abundantly testifies) at most extravagant prices. It is
very well for a veteran in bibliographical literature, as
was Mr. Cracherode, or as are Mr. Wodhull, and Dr.
Gosset&mdash;whose collections were, in part, formed in the days
of De Bure, Gaignat, Askew, Duke de la Valliere, and
Lamoignon&mdash;it is very well for such gentlemen to declaim
against <i>modern prices</i>! But what is to be done? Classical
books grow scarcer every day, and the love of literature,
and of possessing rare and interesting works, increases in
an equal ratio. Hungry bibliographers meet, at sales, with
well-furnished purses, and are resolved upon sumptuous fare!
Thus the hammer <i>vibrates</i>, after a bidding of <span class="smcap">forty pounds</span>,
where formerly it used regularly to <i>fall</i> at <span class="smcap">four</span>! But we
lose sight of Dr. Askew's <i>rare editions</i>, and <i>large paper
copies</i>. The following, gentle reader, is but an imperfect
specimen!

<p>Rare and magnificent as the preceding articles may be
considered, I can confidently assure the reader that they
form a very small part of the extraordinary books in Dr.
<span class="smcap">Askew's</span> library. Many a <i>ten</i> and <i>twenty pounder</i> has been
omitted&mdash;many a <i>prince</i> of an edition passed by unregarded!
The articles were 3570 in number; probably comprehending
about 7000 volumes. They were sold for 4000<i>l.</i> It remains
only to add that Dr. <span class="smcap">Askew</span> was a native of Kendal, in
Westmorland; that he practised as a physician there with
considerable success, and, on his establishment in London,
was visited by all who were distinguished for learning, and
curious in the fine arts. Dr. Mead supported him with a sort
of paternal zeal; nor did he find in his <i>protegé</i> an
ungrateful son. (See the Director, vol. i., p. 309.) Few
minds were probably more congenial than were those of <span class="smcap">Mead</span>
and <span class="smcap">Askew</span>: the former had, if I may so speak, a magnificence
of sentiment which infused into the mind of the latter just
notions of a character aiming at <i>solid intellectual</i> fame;
without the petty arts and dirty tricks which we now see too
frequently pursued to obtain it. Dr. <span class="smcap">Askew</span>, with less
pecuniary means of gratifying it, evinced an equal ardour in
the pursuit of books, MSS., and inscriptions. I have heard
from a very worthy old gentleman, who used to revel 'midst
the luxury of <span class="smcap">Askew's</span> table, that few men exhibited their
books and pictures, or, as it is called, <i>shewed the Lions</i>,
better than did the Doctor. Of his attainments in Greek and
Roman literature it becomes not me to speak, when such a
scholar as Dr. <span class="smcap">Parr</span> has been most eloquent in their praise.
I should observe that the MSS. of Dr. <span class="smcap">Askew</span> were separately
sold in 1781, and produced a very considerable sum. The
Appendix to Scapula, published in an 8vo. volume, in 1789,
was <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: compiled">compiied</span> from one of
these MSS.</p>

<p class="tbp">After an event so striking and so melancholy, one would think that
future <i>Virtuosi</i> would have barricadoed their doors, and fumigated
their chambers, in order to escape the ravages of the
<i>Book-Pest</i>:&mdash;but how few are they who profit by experience, even when
dearly obtained! The subsequent <span class="smcap">History of the Bibliomania</span> is a
striking proof of the truth of this remark: for the disease rather
increased, and the work of death yet went on. In the following year
(1776) died <span class="smcap">John Ratcliffe</span>;<a name="FNanchor_392_398" id="FNanchor_392_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_398" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> a bibliomaniac of a very peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
character. If he had contented himself with his former occupation, and
frequented the butter and cheese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span> instead of the book, market&mdash;if he
could have fancied himself in a brown peruke, and Russian apron,
instead of an embroidered waistcoat, velvet breeches, and flowing
periwig, he might, perhaps, have enjoyed greater longevity; but,
infatuated by the <i>Caxtons</i> and <i>Wynkyn de Wordes</i> of the West and
Fletewode collections, he fell into the snare; and the more he
struggled to disentangle himself, the more certainly did he become a
victim to the disease.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_392_398" id="Footnote_392_398"></a><a href="#FNanchor_392_398">[392]</a> <span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Ratcliffiana</span>; or, "<i>A Catalogue
of the elegant and truly valuable Library of</i> <span class="smcap">John
Ratcliffe</span>, <i>Esq., late of Bermondsey, deceased</i>. The whole

thirty years of his life: comprehending a large and most
choice collection of the rare old English <i>black-letter</i>, in
fine preservation, and in elegant bindings, printed by
Caxton, Lettou, Machlinia, the anonymous St. Alban's
Schoolmaster, Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, Berthelet, Grafton,
Day, Newberie, Marshe, Jugge, Whytchurch, Wyer, Rastell,
Coplande, and the rest of the <i>Old English Typographers</i>:
several missals and MSS., and two pedigrees on vellum,
finely illuminated." The title-page then sets forth a
specimen of these black-letter gems; among which our eyes
are dazzled with a galaxy of Caxtons, Wynkyn de Wordes,
Pynsons, &amp;c., &amp;c. The sale took place on March 27, 1776;
although the <i>year</i> is unaccountably omitted by that
renowned auctioneer, the late Mr. Christie, who disposed of
them. If ever there was a <i>unique</i> collection, this was
one&mdash;the very essence of Old Divinity, Poetry, Romances, and
Chronicles! The articles were only 1675 in number; but their
intrinsic value amply compensated for their paucity. The
following is but an inadequate specimen:

<p>I beg pardon of the <i>manes</i> of "John Ratcliffe, Esq.," for
the very inadequate manner in which I have brought forward
his collection to public notice. The memory of such a man
ought to be dear to the "<i>black-letter-dogs</i>" of the present
day: for he had (mirabile dictu!) <i>upwards of</i> <span class="smcap">Thirty
Caxtons</span>! I take the present opportunity of presenting the
reader with the following engraving of the Ratcliffe
Library, Oxon.</p>

<p><img src="images/ratcliffelibrary.jpg" width="283" height="338" alt="Ratcliffe Library" title="Ratcliffe Library" class="floatr" />
If I might hazard a comparison between Mr. James West's and
Mr. John Ratcliffe's collections, I should say that the
former was more extensive; the latter more curious. Mr.
West's, like a magnificent <i>champagne</i>, executed by the hand
of Claude or Both, and enclosing mountains, meadows, and
streams, presented to the eye of the beholder a scene at
once luxuriant and fruitful: Mr. Ratcliffe's, like one of
those confined pieces of scenery, touched by the pencil of
Rysdael or Hobbima, exhibited to the beholder's eye a spot
equally interesting, but less varied and extensive: the
judgment displayed in both might be the same. The sweeping
foliage and rich pasture of the former could not, perhaps,
afford greater gratification than the thatched cottage,
abrupt declivities, and gushing streams of the latter. To
change the metaphor&mdash;Mr. West's was a magnificent
repository; Mr. Ratcliffe's, a cabinet of curiosities. Of
some particulars of Mr. Ratcliffe's life, I had hoped to
have found gleanings in Mr. Nichols's <i>Anecdotes of Bowyer</i>;
but his name does not even appear in the index; being
probably reserved for the second forth-coming enlarged
edition. Meanwhile, it may not be uninteresting to remark
that, like Magliabechi, (vide <a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>, ante) he imbibed his
love of reading and collecting from the accidental
possession of scraps and leaves of books. The fact is, Mr.
Ratcliffe once kept a <i>chandler's shop</i> in the Borough; and,
as is the case with all retail traders, had great quantities
of old books brought to him to be purchased at so much <i>per
lb.</i>! Hence arose his passion for collecting the
<i>black-letter</i>, as well as <i>Stilton cheeses</i>: and hence, by
unwearied assiduity, and attention to business, he amassed a
sufficiency to retire, and live, for the remainder of his
days, upon the luxury of <span class="smcap">Old English Literature</span>!</p></div>

<p class="tbp">It is with pain that I trace the ravages of the <span class="smcap">Book-Mania</span> to a later
period. Many a heart yet aches, and many a tear is yet shed, on a
remembrance of the mortality of this frightful disease. After the
purchasers of Ratcliffe's treasures had fully perused, and deposited
in fit places within their libraries, some of the scarcest volumes in
the collection, they were called upon to witness a yet more splendid
victim to the Bibliomania: I mean, the Honourable <span class="smcap">Topham
Beauclerk</span>.<a name="FNanchor_393_399" id="FNanchor_393_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_399" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> One, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span> had frequently gladdened <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> in his
gloomy moments; and who is allowed, by that splenetic sage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span> great
teacher of morality, to have united the elegant manners of a gentleman
with the mental accomplishments of a scholar. Beauclerk's Catalogue is
a fair specimen of the analytico-bibliographical powers of Paterson:
yet it must be confessed that this renowned champion of
catalogue-makers shines with greater, and nearly perfect, splendour,
in the collection of the <span class="smcap">Rev. Thomas Crofts</span><a name="FNanchor_394_400" id="FNanchor_394_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_400" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>&mdash;a collection which,
taking it "for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span> in all," I know not whether it be exceeded by any
which this country has recorded in the shape of a private catalogue.
The owner was a modest, careful, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span> acutely sagacious bibliomaniac:
learned, retired, yet communicative: and if ever you lay hold of a
<i>large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span> paper</i> copy of a catalogue of his books, which, as well as the
small, carries the printed prices at the end, seize it in triumph,
Lisardo, for it is a noble volume, and by no means a worthless prize.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_393_399" id="Footnote_393_399"></a><a href="#FNanchor_393_399">[393]</a> There are few libraries better worth the
attention of a scholarlike collector than was the one of the
distinguished character above noticed by Lysander. The
Catalogue of Beauclerk's books has the following title:
"<i>Bibliotheca Beauclerkiana; A Catalogue of the large and
valuable Library of the late Honourable</i> <span class="smcap">Topham Beauclerk</span>,
F.R.S., <i>deceased</i>; comprehending an excellent choice of
books, to the number of upwards of 30,000 volumes, &amp;c. Sold
by auction, by Mr. Paterson, in April, 1781," 8vo. The
catalogue has two parts: part <span class="smcap">i.</span> containing 230; part <i>ii.</i>
137, pp. The most magnificent and costly volume was the
largest paper copy of Dr. Clarke's edition of Cæsar's
Commentaries, 1712, fol., which was sold for 44<i>l.</i>; and of
which the binding, according to Dr. Harwood's testimony,
cost 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> There is nothing, in <i>modern</i> times, very
marvellous in this price of binding. Of the <i>two parts</i> of
the Beauclerk collection, the <i>second</i> is the most valuable
to the collector of English Antiquities and History, and the
<i>first</i> to the general scholar. But let not the bibliomaniac
run too swiftly over the first, for at nos. 3450, 3453, he
will find two books which rank among the rarest of those in
old English poetry. At the close of the second part, there
are a few curious manuscripts; three of which are deserving
of a description here.

<p>I will just add that this catalogue is creditably printed in
a good size octavo volume, and that there are copies upon
<i>large paper</i>. The arrangement of the books is very
creditable to the bibliographical reputation of Paterson.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_394_400" id="Footnote_394_400"></a><a href="#FNanchor_394_400">[394]</a> When the reader is informed that Paterson
tells us, in the preface of this volume, that "In almost
every language and science, and even under the shortest
heads, some one or more rare articles occur; but in the
copious classes, such as follow, literary curiosity is
gratified, is <i>highly feasted</i>"&mdash;and that the author of this
remark used, in his latter days, to hit his knee hard with
his open hand, and exclaim&mdash;"By G&mdash;&mdash;, Crofts' Catalogue is
my chef d'&#339;uvre, out and out"&mdash;when he reflects, I say,
for a minute upon these two bibliographical stimuli, he will
hasten (if he have it not already) to seize upon that volume
of which the following is but an imperfect specimen of the
treasures contained in it: "<i>Bibliotheca Croftsiana: A
Catalogue of the curious and distinguished Library of the
late Reverend and Learned</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas Crofts</span>, A.M., &amp;c. Sold by
auction, by Mr. Paterson, in April, 1783," 8vo. This
collection, containing 8360 articles, although not quite so
generally useful as the preceding, is admirably well
arranged; and evinces, from the rarity of some of the
volumes in the more curious departments of literature, the
sound bibliographical knowledge and correct taste of Mr.
Crofts: who was, in truth, both a scholar and bibliomaniac
of no ordinary reputation. I hasten to treat the reader with
the following <i>Excerpta Croftsiana</i>: being a selection of
articles from this catalogue, quite according with the
present prevailing fashion of Book-Collecting:

<p>This catalogue contains 8360 articles. There are printed
lists of the prices for which each set of books was sold:
but I am afraid that an arrant bibliomaniac, like myself
(for thus my friends are cruel enough to call me!) will be
content only with a <i>large paper</i> copy of it, with the
prices neatly penned in the margin. I conclude that Lysander
recommends the volume in this shape to all tasteful
collectors.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> But there are surely other large paper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> What can there possibly be in a large paper copy of a
<i>Catalogue of Books</i> which merits the appellation of "nobleness" and
"richness?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> You are a little out of order. Such a question cuts the heart
of a bibliographer in twain. Pray let Lysander pursue his narrative.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I have no sort of objection to such interruptions. But I think
the day is not very far distant when females will begin to have as
high a relish for <i>large paper</i> copies of every work as their male
rivals. Now let us go on quietly towards the close of my long-winded
bibliomaniacal history. And first let us not fail to pay due respect
to the cabinet of literary bijoux collected by that renowned
bibliomaniac, <span class="smcap">Mark Cephas Tutet</span>.<a name="FNanchor_395_401" id="FNanchor_395_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_401" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> His collection was distinguished
by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span> some very uncommon articles of early date, both of foreign and
British typography; and, if you take a peep into Lorenzo's priced copy
of the catalogue containing also the purchasers' names, you will find
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span> most notorious modern bibliomaniacs ran away with the choicest
prizes. Tutet's catalogue, although drawn up in a meagre and most
disadvantageous style, is a great favourite with me; chiefly for the
valuable articles which it exhibits.</p>

<p>And thus we take leave of that judicious and tasteful
bibliomaniac, <span class="smcap">Mark Cephas Tutet</span>!
</p><p>
Three months after the sale of the preceding library,
appeared the <i>Bibliotheca Universalis Selecta</i> of <span class="smcap">Samuel
Paterson</span>; containing a collection to be sold by auction in
May, 1786. To this catalogue of 8001 articles, there is a
short (I wish I could add "sweet") preface, which has been
extracted in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. lvi., p. 334;
and in the <i>Censura Literaria</i>, vol. ii., p. 252&mdash;but,
whatever accidental reputation the volume may have received
from the notice of it in these periodical works, I deem both
the preface and the work itself quite unworthy of Paterson's
credit. There is an alphabetical index (not always very
correct); and a few bibliographical notes are subjoined to
the specification of the titles; and these considerations
alone will give the book a place in the library of the
bibliomaniac. The collection is, in fact, neither universal
nor select: and the preface is written in the worst of all
styles, containing the most commonplace observations.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">The following year, was sold, in a similar way, the select and very
curious collection of <span class="smcap">Richard Wright</span>, M.D.;<a name="FNanchor_396_402" id="FNanchor_396_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_402" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> the strength of which
lay chiefly in publications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span> relating to the <i>Drama</i> and <i>Romances</i>.
It is, in my humble opinion, a most judicious, as well as neatly
printed, little catalogue; and not more than a dozen copies of it, I
think, were printed upon <i>large paper</i>. Secure this volume, Lisardo,
if you wish to add to your riches in English bibliography.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_396_402" id="Footnote_396_402"></a><a href="#FNanchor_396_402">[396]</a> Lysander has not drawn too strong an outline
in his picture of the <i>Bibliotheca Wrightiana</i>. The
collection was elegant and select. Let us say a little more
about it. "<i>A Catalogue of the Library of</i> <span class="smcap">Richard Wright</span>,
M.D. &amp;c., consisting of an elegant and extensive collection
of books in every branch of learning, &amp;c., many of the
scarcest editions of the Old English Poets, Novels, and
Romances; also a most singular assemblage of Theatrical
Writers, including the rarest productions of the English
Drama." Sold by auction by T. and J. Egerton, April 23rd,
1787, 8vo. The volume is neatly printed, and the books in
the collection are arranged in alphabetical order under
their respective departments. We will now fill up a little
of the aforementioned strong outline of the picture of
Wright's library: which contained 2824 articles.

<p>My copy of this catalogue is upon <i>large paper</i>, beautifully
priced by a friend who "hath an unrivalled pen in this way;"
and to whom I owe many obligations of a higher kind in the
literary department&mdash;but whose modesty, albeit he was born
on the banks of the Liffey, will not allow me to make the

<p class="tbp"><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> Was Wright's the only collection disposed of at this period,

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_397_403" id="Footnote_397_403"></a><a href="#FNanchor_397_403">[397]</a> <i>A Catalogue of the Library of</i> <span class="smcap">John
Henderson</span>, Esq. (late of Covent Garden Theatre), &amp;c. Sold by
auction by T. and J. Egerton, on February, 1786, 8vo. Do not
let the lover of curious books in general imagine that
Henderson's collection was entirely dramatical. A glance at
the contents of page 12 to page 22, inclusively, will shew
that this library contained some very first-rate rarities.
When the dramatic collector enters upon page 23, (to the end
of the volume, p. 71) I will allow him to indulge in all the
<i>mania</i> of this department of literature, "withouten ony
grudgynge." He may also ring as many <i>peals</i> as it pleaseth
him, upon discovering that he possesses all the copies of a
dramatic author, ycleped <i>George Peele</i>, that are notified
at n<span class="super">os</span>. 923-4! Henderson's library was, without doubt, an
extraordinary one. As we are upon <i>Dramatic Libraries</i>, let
us, for fear Lysander should forget it, notice the
following, though a little out of chronological order. "<i>A
Catalogue, &amp;c., of the late</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">James William Dodd</span>, of the
<i>Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, &amp;c. Sold by auction by Leigh and
Sotheby</i>, Jan. 19, 1797, 8vo., 2435 lots." There was more of
the <i>Drama</i> in this than in Henderson's collection. Mr.
Kemble purchased the dearest volume, which was "Whetstone's
Promos and Cassandra," 1578, 4to. (n<span class="super">o</span>. 2396) for 7<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> Mr. George Nicol (for the late Duke of Roxburgh) kept
up a tremendous fire at this sale! Akin to Dodd's, was the
"<i>Curious and Valuable Library of</i> <span class="smcap">George Smyth</span>, Esq.&mdash;sold
by Leigh and Sotheby, June 2, 1797, 8vo." There were many
uncommon books in this collection, exclusively of those
appertaining to the Drama; and when I mention, in this
latter department&mdash;Hughes's Misfortunes of Prince Arthur,
&amp;c., printed by Robinson, 1587, 4to. (n<span class="super">o</span>. 1376; 16<i>l.</i>
15<i>s.</i>), both the parts of Shakespeare's Henry the Fourth
(1599-1600, 4to., n<span class="super">os</span>. 1436-7; 18<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i>), his Much
Ado about Nothing, 1600, 4to., (n<span class="super">o</span>. 1438; 7<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i>)&mdash;I say enough to sharpen the collector's appetite to
obtain, if he have it not, possession of this curious but
barbarously printed catalogue. To these, let me add the
"<i>Catalogue of a portion of the Library of</i> <span class="smcap">William
Fillingham</span>, Esq., <i>consisting of old quarto plays, early
English Poetry, and a few scarce Tracts, &amp;c., sold by Leigh
and Sotheby</i>, April 1805, 8vo." The arrangement of this
small catalogue is excellent. Many of the books in it are of
the rarest occurrence; and, to my knowledge, were in the
finest preservation. The collector is no more! He died in
India; cut off in the prime of life, and in the midst of his
intellectual and book-collecting ardour! He was a man of
exceedingly gentlemanlike manners, and amiable disposition;
and his taste was, upon the whole, well cultivated and
correct. Many a pleasant, and many a profitable, hour have I
spent in his "delightsome" library!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You are running wild. Let me continue my bibliomaniacal

and so thickly and richly is it sprinkled with the black-letter, and
other curious lore&mdash;so varied, interesting, and valuable, are the
departments into which it is divided&mdash;that it is no wonder his present
Majesty, the late Duke of Roxburgh, and George Steevens, were earnest
in securing some of the choicest gems contained in the same. Such a
collection, sold at the present day&mdash;when there is such a "<i>qui vive</i>"
for the sort of literature which it displays&mdash;what would it produce?
At least four times more, than its sum total, two and twenty years
ago!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_398_404" id="Footnote_398_404"></a><a href="#FNanchor_398_404">[398]</a> If the reader attend only to the above
flourishing eulogy, by Lysander, upon the extraordinary
collection of Major, or Thomas, Pearson, I fear he will not
rise from the perusal of these pages impressed with very
accurate notions of the same. To qualify such ardent
panegyric, and at the same time to please the hearts of all
honest bibliomaniacs, I here subjoin something like a sober
analysis of the <i>Bibliotheca Pearsoniana</i>. The title to the
Sale Catalogue is as follows: "<i>Biblioth. Pearson. A
Catalogue of the Library of</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas Pearson</span>, Esq.
<i>Containing a very extensive Collection of the best and
rarest books in every branch of English Literature, &amp;c. Sold
by Auction by T. and J. Egerton, in April, 1788</i>," 8vo. Like
all the sale catalogues put forth by the Egertons, the
present is both judiciously arranged and neatly printed. It
is said that there are only twelve copies upon <i>large
paper</i>; but I doubt the smallness of this number. My own is
of this kind, superbly bound, and priced with a neatness
peculiar to the calligraphical powers of the 'forementioned
friend. It may not be amiss to prefix an extract from a
newspaper of the day; in which this sale was thus noticed:
"The Black-lettero-mania, which raged so furiously in the
course of last Spring at the Sale of Dr. <span class="smcap">Wright's</span> Books, has
broken out with still greater violence at the present
auction of <span class="smcap">Major Pearson's</span> Library. This assertion may be
countenanced by the following examples." Then follow a few
specimens of the prices given. The reader is now presented
with copious specimens, selected according to their
numerical order: the addenda, between inverted commas, being
copied from the said newspaper.

additions, and was bound in two very large volumes; in this

Roxburghe. After the industrious exertions of two such
skilful collectors as Major Pearson and Mr. Reed, the Duke
did not flatter himself with ever being able to add much to
the collection; but, as usual, he undervalued his own
industry. Finding that his success far exceeded his
expectations, he determined to add a <i>third volume</i> to the
collection. Among these new acquisitions are some very rare
ballads; one quoted by Hamlet, of which no other copy is
known to exist." <i>Preface to the Roxburgh Catalogue</i>, p. 5.

<p class="bp">In the year 1789 the book-treasures of the far-famed <span class="smcap">Pinelli</span><a name="FNanchor_399_405" id="FNanchor_399_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_405" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>
Collection were disposed of by public auction:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span> nor can one think,
without some little grief of heart, upon the dispersion of a library,
which (much more than commercial speculations and profits) had, for
upwards of a century, reflected so much credit upon the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span> of its
possessors. The atmosphere of our metropolis, about this period,
became as much infected with the miasmata of the <span class="smcap">Book-Plague</span> as it
did, about 130 years before, with the miasmata of a plague of a
different description: for the worthy inhabitants of Westminster had
hardly recovered from the shock of the bibliomaniacal attack from the
Pinelli sale, 'ere they were doomed to suffer the tortures of a
similar one in that of the <span class="smcap">Paris</span><a name="FNanchor_400_406" id="FNanchor_400_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_406" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> collection. This latter was of
shorter dura<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>tion; but of an infinitely more powerful nature: for then
you might have seen the most notorious bibliomaniacs, with blood
inflamed and fancies intoxicated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span> rushing towards the examination of
the truly matchless volumes contained within this collection. Yet
remember that, while the whole of Pall Mall was thronged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span> with the
carriages of collectors, anxious to carry off in triumph some <i>vellum
copy</i> of foreign execution&mdash;there was sold, in a quiet corner of the
metropolis, the copious and scholar-like collection of <span class="smcap">Michael Lort</span>,
D.D. The owner of this latter library was a learned and amiable
character, and a bibliographer of no mean repute.<a name="FNanchor_401_407" id="FNanchor_401_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_407" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span> books were
frequently enriched with apposite <span class="smcap">ms.</span> remarks; and the variety and
extent of his collection, suited to all tastes, and sufficiently
abundant for every appetite, forms, I think, a useful model after
which future bibliomaniacs may build their libraries.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_399_405" id="Footnote_399_405"></a><a href="#FNanchor_399_405">[399]</a> Mention has already been made of the

21</a>, ante. Here, as Lysander has thought proper again to
notice the name of the collector, I am tempted to add a few
specimens of the extraordinary books contained in his
extraordinary library: adding thereto the prices for which
they were sold. But&mdash;again and again I observe, <i>in
limine</i>&mdash;these sums form no criterion of the <i>present</i> worth
of the books; be the same more or less! It is a document
only of bibliographical curiosity.

<p>It probably escaped Lysander that, while the sale of the
Pinelli collection attracted crowds of bibliomaniacs to
Conduit Street, Hanover Square, a very fine library was
disposed of, in a quiet and comfortable manner, at the rooms
of Messrs. Leigh and Sotheby, in York Street, Covent Garden;
under the following title to the catalogue: <i>A Catalogue of
a very elegant and curious Cabinet of Books, lately imported
from France</i>, &amp;c. (sold in May, 1789). My priced copy of
this catalogue affixes the name (in MS.) of <span class="smcap">Macartney</span>, as
the owner of this precious "Cabinet." There were only 1672
articles; containing a judicious sprinkling of what was
elegant, rare, and curious, in almost every department of
literature. The eleventh and twelfth days' sale were devoted
to MSS.; many of them of extraordinary beauty and
singularity. It was from this collection, n<span class="super">o</span>. 248, that
Lord Spencer obtained, for a comparatively small sum, one of
the most curious books (if not an unique volume) in the
class of early English printed ones, which are in his own
matchless collection. It is the "<i>Siege of Rhodes</i>," which
has a strong appearance of being the production of Caxton's
press. The copy is perfectly clean and almost uncut.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_400_406" id="Footnote_400_406"></a><a href="#FNanchor_400_406">[400]</a> If the reader will be pleased to turn to
<a href="#Page_90">page 90</a>, ante, he will find a tolerably copious and correct list
of the different sales of books which were once in the
possession of <span class="smcap">Mons. Paris de Meyzieux</span>. In the same place he
will also find mention made of a singular circumstance
attending the sale of the above collection noticed by
Lysander. As a corollary, therefore, to what has been before
observed, take the following specimens of the books&mdash;with
the prices for which they are sold&mdash;which distinguished the
<i>Bibliotheca Parisiana</i>. They are from the French Catalogue,
1790, 8vo.

London, and especially of the book-auction species&mdash;is a
point which I cannot take upon me to decide. Certain it is
that the notes of their great poet are not deficient in
numerous tempting extracts from rare black-letter tomes; and
if his example be not more generally followed than it is,
the fault must lie with some scribe or other who counteracts
its influence by propagating opinions, and recommending
studies, of a different, and less tasteful, cast of
character. I am fearful that there are too many
politico-economical, metaphysical, and philosophical
miasmata, floating in the atmosphere of Scotland's

exhibiting, in pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span> nearly an equal degree, some of the rarest
books in Greek, Latin, and English literature. The <i>keimelion</i> of the

was a perfect copy of the <i>St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span> Albans' edition</i> of Juliana Barnes's
book of <i>Hawking, Hunting</i>, and <i>Angling</i>; which perfect copy is now
reposing in a collection where there are <i>keimelia</i> of far greater
value to dim its wonted lustre. But let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span> Mason have our admiration and

which now perhaps cannot be rightly ascertained. See here,

amongst other things, to stimulate thee to be equally choice
and careful in the gathering of similar fruits.

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_408_414" id="Footnote_408_414"></a><a href="#FNanchor_408_414">[408]</a> There is but a scanty memorial of this
extraordinary and ever respectable bibliomaniac, in the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>; vol. lxvii. pt. ii. p. 805: 888: nor
is it noticed, among Farmer's theologico-literary labours,
that he was author of an ingenious essay upon the
<i>Demoniacs</i> mentioned in scripture; in which essay he took
up the idea of Mede, that these Demoniacs were <i>madmen</i>. Dr.
Farmer's essay upon the <i>Learning of Shakespeare</i> is, in
respect to the materials, arguments, and conclusions&mdash;what
the late Bishop of Salisbury's [Douglas] was upon
<i>Miracles</i>&mdash;original, powerful, and incontrovertible. Never
was there an octavo volume, like Farmer's upon
Shakespeare&mdash;which embraced so many, and such curious,
points, and which displayed such research, ingenuity, and
acuteness&mdash;put forth with so little pomp, parade, or
pedantry. Its popularity was remarkable; for it delighted
both the superficial and deeply-versed reader in
black-letter lore. Dr. Parr's well applied Ciceronian
phrase, in lauding the "ingenious and joy-inspiring
language" of Farmer, gives us some notion of the colloquial
powers of this acute bibliomaniac; whose books were
generally scattered upon the floor, as Lysander above
observes, like old Richard Smith's "stitched bundles."
Farmer had his foragers; his jackalls: and his
avant-couriers: for it was well known how dearly he loved
every thing that was interesting and rare in the literature
of former ages. As he walked the streets of London&mdash;careless
of his dress&mdash;and whether his wig was full-bottomed or
narrow-bottomed&mdash;he would talk and "mutter strange speeches"
to himself; thinking all the time, I ween, of some curious
discovery he had recently made in the aforesaid precious
black-letter tomes. But the reader is impatient for the
<i>Bibliotheca Farmeriana</i>: the title to the catalogue whereof
is as follows. "<i>Bibl. Farm. A Catalogue of the curious,
valuable, and extensive Library in print and manuscript, of
the late</i> <span class="smcap">Rev. Richard Farmer</span>, <i>D.D., Canon Residentiary of
St. Paul's; Master of Emanuel College: Librarian to the
University of Cambridge; and Fellow of the Royal &amp; Antiquary
Societies</i> (deceased, &amp;c.) Sold by Auction by Mr. King; May,
1798," 8vo. [8199 articles]. The collection is justly said,
in the title page, to contain the "most rare and copious
assemblage of <i>Old English Poetry</i> that, perhaps, was ever
exhibited at one view; together with a great variety of <i>Old
Plays</i>, and early printed books, English and Foreign, in the
black-letter." The reader has already (<a href="#Page_324">p. 324</a> ante) had some
intimation of the source to which Dr. Farmer was chiefly
indebted for these poetical and dramatical treasures; of
some of which, "hereafter followeth" an imperfect specimen:

translation was by Archbishop Parker, and is so scarce that
Mr. Strype tells us he could never get a sight of it." See
Master's History of C.C.C.C. Mr. Wharton supposes it never
to have been published, but that the Archbishop's wife gave
away some copies. "It certainly (he adds) is at this time
extremely scarce, and would be deservedly deemed a fortunate
acquisition to those capricious students who labour to
collect a Library of Rarities." Hist. of Eng. Poetry, vol.

<p>And here, benevolent reader, let us bid farewell to <span class="smcap">Richard
Farmer</span> of transcendant bibliomaniacal celebrity! It is in
vain to look forward for the day when book-gems, similar to
those which have just been imperfectly described from the
<i>Bibl. Farmeriana</i>, will be disposed of at similar prices.
The young collector may indulge an ardent hope; but, if
there be any thing of the spirit of prophecy in my humble
predictions, that hope will never be realised. Dr. Farmer's
copies were, in general, in sorry condition; the possessor
caring little (like Dr. Francis Bernard; vide <a href="#Page_316">p. 316</a>, ante)
for large margins and splendid binding. His own name,
generally accompanied with a bibliographical remark, and
both written in a sprawling character, usually preceded the
title-page. The science (dare I venture upon so magnificent
a word?) of bibliography was, even in Farmer's latter time,
but jejune, and of limited extent: and this will account for
some of the common-place bibliographical memoranda of the
owner of these volumes. We may just add that there are some
few copies of this catalogue printed on <i>large paper</i>, on
paper of a better quality than the small; which latter is
sufficiently wretched. I possess a copy of the former kind,
with the <i>prices</i> and <i>purchasers' names</i> affixed&mdash;and
moreover, <i>uncut</i>!</p>

<p class="tbp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>A poor eulogy, this, upon Farmer!&mdash;but my oratory begins to wax faint.

Mason's, than of Farmer's, it was rich to an excess in choice and rare
pieces. Nor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span> it an uninteresting occupation to observe, in looking
among the prices, the enormous sums which were given for some volumes

comparatively with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span> their present worth, would bring considerably
higher prices! What arduous contention, "<i>Renardine shifts</i>," and bold

<p>The respectable compiler of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol.
lxx. p. 178, has given us some amusing particulars of
Steevens's literary life: of his coming from Hampstead to
London, at the chill break of day, when the overhanging
clouds were yet charged with the 'inky' purple of night&mdash;in
order, like a true book-chevalier, to embrace the first dank
impression, or proof sheet, of his own famous octavo edition
of <i>Shakspeare</i>; and of Mr. Bulmer's sumptuous impression of
the text of the same. All this is well enough, and savours
of the proper spirit of <span class="smcap">Bibliomaniacism</span>: and the edition of
our immortal bard, in fifteen well printed octavo volumes,
(1793) is a splendid and durable monument of the researches
of George Steevens. There were from 20 to 25 copies of the
octavo edition printed upon <span class="smcap">large paper</span>; and Lord Spencer
possesses, by bequest, Mr. Steevens' own copy of the same,
illustrated with a great number of rare and precious prints;
to which, however, his Lordship, with his usual zeal and
taste, has made additions more valuable even than the gift
in its original form. The 8vo. edition of 1793 is covetted
with an eagerness of which it is not very easy to account
for the cause; since the subsequent one of 1803, in 21
octavo volumes, is more useful on many accounts: and
contains Steevens's corrections and additions in every play,
as well as 177, in particular, in that of Macbeth. But I am
well aware of the stubbornness and petulancy with which the
previous edition is contended for in point of superiority,
both round a private and public table; and, leaving the
collector to revel in the luxury of an uncut, half-bound,
morocco copy of the same, I push onward to a description of
the <i>Bibliotheca Steevensiana</i>. Yet a parting word
respecting this edition of 1803. I learn, from
unquestionable authority, that Steevens stipulated with the
publishers that they should pay Mr. Reed 300<i>l.</i> for
editorship, and 100<i>l.</i> to Mr. W. Harris, Librarian of the
Royal Institution, for correcting the press: nor has the
editor in his preface parted from the truth, in
acknowledging Mr. Harris to be 'an able and
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: vigilant">vigiland</span> assistant.' Mr. H. retained,
for some time, Steevens' corrected copy of his own edition
of 1793, but he afterwards disposed of it, by public
auction, for 28<i>l.</i> He has also at this present moment, Mr.
Josiah Boydell's copy of Mr. Felton's picture of our
immortal bard; with the following inscription, painted on
the back of the pannel, by Mr. Steevens:</p>

<p>The engraved portrait of Shakspeare, prefixed to this
edition of 1803, is by no means a faithful resemblance of
Mr. Boydell's admirably executed copy in oil. The expenses
of the edition amounted to 5844<i>l.</i>; but no copies now
remain with the publishers. We will now give rather a
copious, and, as it must be acknowledged, rich, sprinkling
of specimens from the <i>Bibliotheca Steevensiana</i>, in the

<p class="blockquot">There were copies of the Catalogue of Steeven's books struck
off on <span class="smcap">large paper</span>, on bastard <i>royal octavo</i>, and in
<i>quarto</i>.</p>

<p>It remains to say a few words of the celebrated collector of
this very curious library. The wit, taste, and classical
acquirements of <span class="smcap">George Steevens</span> are every where recorded and
acknowledged. As an editor of his beloved Shakspeare, he
stands unrivalled; for he combined, with much recondite
learning and indefatigable research, a polish of style, and
vigour of expression, which are rarely found united in the
same person. His definitions are sometimes both happy and
singular; and his illustrations of ancient customs and
manners such as might have been expected from a head so
completely furnished, and a hand so thoroughly practised. I
will not say that George Steevens has evinced the learning
of Selden upon Drayton, or of Bentley upon Phalaris; nor did
his erudition, in truth, rise to the lofty and commanding
pitch of these his predecessors: nor does there seem much
sense or wit in hunting after every <i>pencil-scrap</i> which
this renowned bibliomaniac committed to paper&mdash;as some sadly
bitten book-collectors give evidence of. If I have not
greatly misunderstood the characteristics of Steevens's
writings, they are these&mdash;wit, elegance, gaiety, and satire,
combined with almost perfect erudition in English dramatic
antiquities. Let us give a specimen of his classical
elegance in dignifying a subject, which will be relished
chiefly by <span class="smcap">Grangerites</span>. Having learnt that a copy of
Skelton's Verses on Elinour Rummin, the famous Ale-wife of
England, with her portrait in the title-page, was in the
Library of the Cathedral of Lincoln (perhaps, formerly,
Captain Coxe's copy; vide <a href="#Page_266">p. 266</a>, ante), he prevailed on the
late Dean, Sir Richard Kaye, to bring the book to London;
but as it was not suffered to go from the Dean's possession,
Mr. S. was permitted to make a <i>fac-simile</i> drawing of the
title, at the Dean's house in Harley-street. This drawing he
gave to Richardson, the printseller, who engraved and
published it among the copies of scarce portraits to
illustrate Granger. The acquisition of this rarity produced
from him the following <i>Jeu d'Esprit</i>; the merit of which
can only be truly appreciated by those who had the pleasure
of knowing the eminent <span class="smcap">Portrait Collectors</span> therein
mentioned, and whose names are printed in capital letters.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that this is at once elegant and happy.</p>

<hr class="med" />

<p>We will now say somewhat of the man himself. Mr. Steevens
lived in a retired and eligibly situated house, just on the
rise of Hampstead Heath. It was paled in; and had,
immediately before it, a verdant lawn skirted with a variety
of picturesque trees. Formerly, this house has been a
tavern, which was known by the name of the <i>Upper Flask</i>:
and which my fair readers (if a single female can have the
courage to peruse these bibliomaniacal pages) will recollect
to have been the same to which Richardson sends Clarissa in
one of her escapes from Lovelace. Here Steevens lived,
embosomed in books, shrubs, and trees: being either too coy,
or too unsociable, to mingle with his neighbours. His habits
were indeed peculiar: not much to be envied or imitated; as
they sometimes betrayed the flights of a madman, and
sometimes the asperities of a cynic. His attachments were
warm, but fickle both in choice and duration. He would
frequently part from one, with whom he had lived on terms of
close intimacy, without any assignable cause; and his
enmities, once fixed, were immovable. There was, indeed, a
kind of venom in his antipathies; nor would he suffer his
ears to be assailed, or his heat to relent, in favour of
those against whom he entertained animosities, however
capricious and unfounded. In <i>one</i> pursuit only was he
consistent: <i>one</i> object only did he woo with an inflexible
attachment; and that object was <i>Dame</i> <span class="smcap">Drama</span>.
</p><p>
I have sat behind him, within a few years of his death, and
watched his sedulous attention to the performances of
strolling players, who used to hire a public room in
Hampstead; and towards whom his gallantry was something more
substantial than mere admiration and applause: for he would
make liberal presents of gloves, shoes, and
stockings&mdash;especially to the female part of the company. His
attention, and even delight, during some of the most
wretched exhibitions of the dramatic art, was truly
surprising; but he was then drooping under the pressure of
age, and what passed before him might serve to remind him of
former days, when his discernment was quick and his judgment
matured. It is, however, but justice to this distinguished
bibliomaniac to add that, in his literary attachments he was
not influenced by merely splendid talents or exalted rank.
To my predecessor <span class="smcap">Herbert</span> (for whose memory I may be
allowed, at all times, to express a respectful regard)
Steevens seems to have shewn marked attention. I am in
possession of more than a dozen original letters from him to
this typographical antiquary, in which he not only evinces
great friendliness of disposition, but betrays an unusual
solicitude about the success of Herbert's labours; and,
indeed, contributes towards it by nearly a hundred notices
of rare and curious books which were unknown to, or
imperfectly described by, Herbert himself. At the close of a
long letter, in which, amongst much valuable information,
there is a curious list of <span class="smcap">Churchyard's</span> <i>Pieces</i>&mdash;which
Steevens urges Herbert to publish&mdash;he thus concludes:
</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="letter">"I know not where the foregoing lists of Churchyard's Pieces
can appear with more propriety than in a work like yours;
and I therefore venture to recommend them as worth
republication. If you publish, from time to time, additions
to your book, you may have frequent opportunity of doing
similar service to old English literature, by assembling
catalogues of the works of scarce, and therefore almost
forgotten, authors. By occasional effusions of this kind you
will afford much gratification to literary antiquaries, and
preserve a constant source of amusement to yourself: for in
my opinion, no man is so unhappy as he who is at a loss for
something to do. Your present task grows towards an end, and
I therefore throw out this hint for your consideration."
(<i>July</i> 27, 1789.)</p>
</div>

<p>A little further he adds: "In your vol. ii. p. 1920, you
have but an imperfect account of <span class="smcap">Tyro's</span> '<i>Roaring Megge</i>,'
&amp;c. I shall therefore supply it underneath, as the book now
lies before me. I have only room left to tell you I am
always your very faithfully, <span class="smcap">G. Steevens</span>." But the
bibliomanical spirit of the author of this letter, is
attested by yet stronger evidence:

<p class="letter">"I have borrowed the following books for your use&mdash;Dr.
Farmer's copy of Ames, with MS. notes by himself, and an
interleaved Maunsell's Catalogue, with yet more considerable
additions by Baker the antiquary. The latter I have promised
to return at the end of this month, as it belongs to our
University Library. I should not choose to transmit either
of these volumes by any uncertain conveyance; and therefore
shall be glad if you will let me know how they may be safely
put into your hands. If you can fix a time when you shall be
in London, my servant shall wait on you with them; but I
must entreat that our library book may be detained as short
a time as possible. I flatter myself that it will prove of
some service to you, and am,</p>

equal pleasure to send you the earliest assurance of it. I
thank you sincerely for the liberty you have allowed me of
keeping them till I come to London, on Monday, the 4th of
September; when I shall bring them with me, and hope to
return them safe at Mr. Longman's, between 10 and 11

very happy to meet you, and personally to thank you for the

<p>The following, and the last, epistolary specimen of the
renowned G. Steevens&mdash;with which I shall treat my reader&mdash;is
of a general gossipping black-letter cast; and was written
two years before the preceding.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><i>Hampstead Heath</i>, June 26th, 1788.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</span></p>

<p class="letter">"A desire to know how you do, and why so long a time has
elapsed since you were seen in London, together with a few
queries which necessity compels me to trouble you with, must
be my apology for this invasion of your retirement. Can you
furnish me with a transcript of the title-page to Watson's
Sonnets or Love Passions, 4to. bl. l.? As they are not
mentioned by Puttenham, in 1589, they must, I think, have
appeared after that year. Can you likewise afford me any
account of a Collection of Poems, bl. l., 4to. by one John
Southern? They are addressed 'to the ryght honourable the
Earle of Oxenforde;' the famous Vere, who was so much a
favourite with Queen Elizabeth. This book, which contains
only four sheets, consists of Odes, Epitaphs, Sonnets to
Diana, &amp;c. I bought both these books, which seem to be
uncommonly rare, at the late sale of Major Pearson's
Library. They are defective in their title-pages, and
without your assistance must, in all probability, continue
imperfect. Give me leave to add my sincere hope that your
long absence from London has not been the result of
indisposition, and that you will forgive this interruption
in your studies, from</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Your very faithful and obedient Servant,</span></p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Geo. Steevens.</span>"</p>

<p>"P.S. I hope your third volume is in the press, as it is
very much enquired after."</p>
</div>

<p>It is now time to bid farewell to the subject of this
tremendous note; and most sincerely do I wish I could 'draw
the curtain' upon it, and say 'good night,' with as much
cheerfulness and satisfaction <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: as">at</span>
Atterbury did upon the close of his professional labours.
But the latter moments of <span class="smcap">Steevens</span> were moments of mental
anguish. He grew not only irritable, but outrageous; and, in
full possession of his faculties, he raved in a manner which
could have been expected only from a creature bred up
without notions of morality or religion. Neither complacency
nor 'joyful hope' soothed his bed of death. His language
was, too frequently, the language of imprecation; and his
wishes and apprehensions such as no rational Christian can
think upon without agony of heart. Although I am not
disposed to admit the whole of the testimony of the good
woman who watched by his bed-side, and paid him, when dead,
the last melancholy attentions of her office&mdash;although my
prejudices (as they may be called) will not allow me to
believe that the windows shook, and that strange noises and
deep groans were heard at midnight in his room&mdash;yet no
creature of common sense (and this woman possessed the
quality in an eminent degree) could mistake oaths for
prayers, or boisterous treatment for calm and gentle usage.
If it be said&mdash;why</p>

<p class="center">"draw his frailties from their drear abode?"</p>

<p>the answer is obvious, and, I should hope, irrefragable. A
duty, and a sacred one too, is due <span class="smcap">to the living</span>. Past
examples operate upon future ones: and posterity ought to
know, in the instance of this accomplished scholar and
literary antiquary, that neither the sharpest wit, nor the
most delicate intellectual refinement, can, alone, afford a
man '<span class="smcap">peace at the last</span>.' The vessel of human existence must
be secured by other anchors than these, when the storm of
death approaches!</p>

be noticed. The catalogue of the library of the former is a great
favourite of mine: the departments into which the books are divided,
and the compendious descriptions of the volumes, together with the
extent and variety of the collection, may afford considerable
assistance to judicious bibliomaniacs. Poor <span class="smcap">Woodhouse</span>:<a name="FNanchor_411_417" id="FNanchor_411_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_417" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> thy zeal

<p>For an interesting account of the engravings of the
<span class="smcap">Devonshire Gems</span>&mdash;the rival publication of those from the
Marlborough collection&mdash;the reader may consult Mr. Beloe's
<i>Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books</i>; vol. <span class="smcap">i.</span> 182-6.
The entire collection of Mr. Woodhouse's prints produced
3595<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
</p><p>
We will now make handsome mention of the <span class="smcap">Bibliotheca
Woodhousiana</span>. <i>A Catalogue of the entire, elegant, and
valuable Library of John Woodhouse, Esq., comprising a rich
and extensive collection of books, &amp;c. Sold by auction by
Leigh and Sotheby, December, 1803.</i> 8vo. The collection was
rather choice and rich, than extensive: having only 861
articles. Some of the rarest editions in old English
Literature were vigorously contended for by well-known
collectors: nor did the Library want beautiful and useful
works of a different description. The following specimens
will enable the reader to form a pretty correct estimate of
the general value of this collection.

<p>Early in the year in which this collection was disposed of,
the very beautiful choice, and truly desirable library of
<span class="smcap">George Galway Mills</span>, Esq. was sold by auction by Mr.
Jeffery, in February, 1800. My copy of this well-executed
catalogue is upon <i>large paper</i>; but it has not the prices
subjoined. Meanwhile let the sharp-sighted bibliomaniac look
at n<span class="super">o</span>. 28, 68, 85, 106, 181, 412, 438, only. Thus it will
be seen that the year 1800 was most singularly distinguished
for <i>Book-Auction Bibliomaniacism</i>!

We now proceed to notice the sales of the libraries of those
bibliomaniacs above mentioned by Lysander. <i>A catalogue of

<p>The year ensuing (of which Lysander has, very negligently,
taken no notice) was distinguished for the sale of a
collection of books, the like unto which had never been
seen, since the days of the dispersion of the Parisian
collection. The title of the auction catalogue was, in part,
as follows: <i>A Catalogue of a most splendid and valuable
collection of Books, superb missals, original drawings, &amp;c.
the genuine property of a Gentleman of distinguished taste,
retiring into the country, &amp;c.</i> Sold by auction by Mr.

<p>From n<span class="super">o</span>. 292 to 307, inclusive (only 14 volumes), there
was a set of "<i>Painted Missals and curious manuscripts</i>,"
which were sold for 724<i>l.</i> Among them, was Mr. John
Towneley's matchless missal, decorated by the famous
Francesco Veronese&mdash;"one of the finest productions of the
kind ever imported from Italy:" see n<span class="super">o</span>. 296. For an
account of the books <span class="smcap">printed upon vellum</span> in this collection,
see <a href="#PART_VI"><span class="smcap">Part VI</span></a>. Let us close this note with the <i>Bibliotheca
Boucheriana</i>; of which such respectable mention is above
justly made by Lysander. "<i>A Catalogue of the very valuable
and extensive Library of the late</i> <span class="smcap">Rev. Jonathan Boucher</span>,
<i>A.M., F.R.S., Vicar of Epsom, Surrey. Comprehending a fine
and curious collection in Divinity, History, &amp;c.: sold by
auction by Leigh and Sotheby; in February</i>, 1806." <i>First
part</i>, 6646 articles: <i>Second part</i>, 1933 articles: <i>Third
part</i>, published in 1809: 857 articles. I attended many days
during this sale; but such was the warm fire, directed
especially towards divinity, kept up during nearly the whole
of it, that it required a heavier weight of metal than I was
able to bring into the field of battle to ensure any success
in the contest. I cannot help adding that these catalogues
are wretchedly printed.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_413_419" id="Footnote_413_419"></a><a href="#FNanchor_413_419">[413]</a> For the same reason as has been adduced at
<a href="#Page_427">p. 427</a>, ante, and from a strong wish to render this <i>List of
Book Auctions</i> as perfect as my opportunities will allow, I
shall persevere, at the foot of Lysander's narrative, in
submitting to the attention of the curious reader a still
further account of sales than those above alluded to in the
text. As this will be the last note in <a href="#PART_V"><span class="smcap">Part V.</span></a>, I hope,
however late the hour, or exhausted his patience, that the
reader will also persevere to the close of it, and then wish
the author "good night," along with his friends, whose
salutations are above so dramatically described. At the very
opening of the year in which Mr. Boucher's books were sold,
the magnificent collection of the Marquis of Lansdowne was
disposed of. I well remember the original destination of
this numerous library: I well remember the long, beautiful,
and classically ornamented room, in which, embellished and
guarded by busts, and statues of gods and heroes, the books
were ranged in quiet and unmolested order, adjoining to the
noblest mansion in London. If the consideration of external,
or out-of-door, objects be put out of the question, this
Library-room had not its superior in Great Britain. Let us
now come to particulars: "<i>Bibliotheca Lansdowniana. A
Catalogue of the entire Library of the late most noble
William</i> <span class="smcap">Marquis of Lansdowne</span>; <i>sold by auction by Leigh and

<p>I should observe that the <span class="smcap">Prints</span> or <span class="smcap">Engravings</span> of the
Marquis, together with the <i>printed prices</i> for which they,
and the foregoing library, were sold, are usually added to
the Catalogue of the Books. In the spring of 1807, the
<span class="smcap">Manuscripts</span> belonging to the same noble collector were
catalogued to be sold by public auction. These manuscripts,
in the preface of the <i>first</i> volume of the Catalogue, are
said to 'form one of the noblest and most valuable private
collections in the kingdom.' It is well known that the
collection never came to the hammer; but was purchased by
parliament for 6000<i>l.</i>, and is deposited in the British
Museum. A catalogue of it is now <i>sub prelo</i>; vide <a href="#Page_89">p. 89</a>,
ante. We are next to notice the sale by auction of the
library of the late Rev. John Brand. The first part of this
collection was disposed of in the Spring of 1807; and the
catalogue had this title: <i>Bibliotheca Brandiana. A
Catalogue of the unique, scarce, rare, curious, and numerous
collection of Works, &amp;c., being the entire Library of the
late</i> <span class="smcap">Rev. John Brand</span>, <i>Fellow and Secretary of the
Antiquarian Society, Author of the History of Newcastle,
Popular Antiquities, &amp;c. Sold by auction by Mr. Stewart</i>,
May, 1807. This first part contained 8611 articles, or lots,
of printed books; exclusively of 243 lots of manuscripts.
Hereafter followeth, gentle reader, some specimens, selected
almost at random, of the 'unique, scarce, rare, and curious'
books contained in the said library of this far-famed
Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries.

<p>My copy of this first part of the Catalogue of Brand's books
is upon <i>large paper, with the prices inserted in the
margin</i>. The <i>second part</i> of the <span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Brandiana</span>,
containing duplicates and Pamphlets, was sold in February,
1808, by Mr. Stewart. There were 4064 articles. Few
collections attracted greater attention before, and during,
the sale than did the library of the late Mr. Isaac Reed: a
critic and literary character of very respectable
second-rate reputation. The public Journals teemed, for a
time, with book-anecdotes concerning this collection; and
the <i>Athenæum</i>, <i>Monthly Mirror</i>, <i>Censura Literaria</i>,
<i>European Magazine</i>, struck out a more bold outline of the
Bibliotheca Reediana than did the generality of their fellow
Journals. Reed's portrait is prefixed to the European
Magazine, the Monthly Mirror, and the Catalogue of his own
Books: it is an indifferently stippled scraping, copied from
a fine mellow mezzotint, from the characteristic pencil of
Romney. This latter is a private plate, and, as such, is
rare. To return to the Library. The preface to the Catalogue
was written by the Rev. H.J. Todd. It is brief, judicious,
and impressive; giving abundant proof of the bibliomaniacal
spirit of the owner of the library&mdash;who would appear to have
adopted the cobler's well-known example of applying one room
to almost every domestic purpose: for Reed made his library
'his parlour, kitchen, and hall.' A brave and enviable
spirit this!&mdash;and, in truth, what is comparable with it? But
the reader is beginning to wax impatient for a more
particular account. Here it is: <i>Bibliotheca Reediana. A
Catalogue of the curious and extensive Library of the late
Isaac Reed, Esq., of Staple Inn, deceased. Comprehending a
most extraordinary collection of books in English
Literature, &amp;c.: sold by auction, by Messrs. King and
Lochée: November</i>, 1807, <i>8vo.</i> The following specimens of
some of Reed's scarce volumes are copied, in part, from the
account which was inserted in the <i>Athenæum</i>, vol. iii., pp.
61, 157, under the extraordinary signatures of W. Caxton and
W. de Worde.

Before we proceed to give an account of subsequent
book-sales, it may be as well to pause for a few
minutes&mdash;and to take a retrospective view of the busy scene
which has been, in part, described: or rather, it may be no
incurious thing to lay before the reader for a future
century (when the ashes of the author shall have long
mouldered into their native dust) a statement of the
principal book-sales which took place from November, 1806,
to November, 1807&mdash;at Messrs. Leigh and Sotheby's King and
Lochée's, and Mr. Stewart's. The minor ones carried on under
Covent-Garden Piazza, Tom's Coffee-house, &amp;c., are not
necessary to be noticed. In calculating the number of
volumes, I have considered one article, or lot, with the
other, to comprehend three volumes. The result is as
follows.</p>

<p>Such has been the circulation of books, within the foregoing
period, by the hands of <i>three Auctioneers only</i>; and the
prices which a great number of <i>useful</i> articles brought is
a sufficient demonstration that books are esteemed for their
<i>intrinsic value</i>, as well as for the adventitious
circumstances which render them <i>rare</i> or <i>curious</i>. But
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: posterity">prosterity</span> are not to judge
of the prevalence of knowledge in these times by the
criterion of, what are technically called, <i>book-sales</i>
only. They should be told that, within the same twelve
months, thousands and tens of thousands of books of all
sorts have been circulated by the <i>London Booksellers</i>; and
that, without travelling to know the number disposed of at
Bristol, Liverpool, York, Manchester, or Exeter, it may be
only necessary to state that <i>one distinguished House</i>
alone, established not quite a furlong from the railings of
St. Paul's Cathedral, sold not far short of <i>two hundred
thousand volumes</i> within the foregoing period! If learning
continue thus to thrive, and books to be considered as
necessary furniture to an apartment; if wealthy merchants
are resolved upon procuring Large Paper copies, as well as
Indian spices and Russian furs; we may hail, in
anticipation, that glorious period when the book-fairs of
<i>Leipsic</i> shall be forgotten in the superior splendour of
those of <i>London</i>! But to return to our chronological order:
The ensuing year, 1808, was distinguished for no small
mischief excited in the bibliomaniacal world by the sales of
many curious and detached libraries. The second part of Mr.
Brand's collection which was sold in the spring of this
year, has been already noticed. The close of the year
witnessed the sales, by auction, of the books of <span class="smcap">Samuel
Ewer</span>, Esq. (retiring into the country), and of Mr. <span class="smcap">Machel
Stace</span>, bookseller. The former collection was very strong in
bibliography; and the latter presented a singularly valuable
'Collection of rare and select' books, relating to old
English Literature elegantly bound: containing 2607
articles. Mr. Stace had published, the preceding year, '<i>A
Catalogue of curious and scarce Books and Tracts</i>:' which,
with the preceding, merit a snug place upon the
bibliographer's shelf. We now enter upon a more busy year of
sales of books by auction. The Bibliomania had only
increased by the preceding displays of precious and
magnificent volumes. And first came on, in magnitude and
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: importance">inportance</span>, the sales of
<span class="smcap">Alexander Dalrymple</span> and <span class="smcap">Professor Porson</span>. Of these in turn.
<i>A Catalogue of the extensive and valuable Library of Books:
Part I. Late the property of</i> <span class="smcap">Alex. Dalrymple</span>, Esq. F.R.S.,
<i>deceased</i>. Hydrographer to the Board of Admiralty, and the
Hon. East India Company, &amp;c., sold by auction by King and
Lochée, May 29, 1809, 8vo.&mdash;7190 articles: <i>A Catalogue,
&amp;c., Part II. of the same: sold by auction by the same</i>:
Nov. 1809.&mdash;8897 articles. I should add that there is a
stippled engraving of Dalrymple, with fac-simile of his
hand-writing, which faces the title page to <i>Part First</i> of
this extraordinary and numerous collection; of books of
Geography, Voyages, and Travels. I strongly recommend copies
of these catalogues to be in every library of extent and
utility. We are now to notice: <i>A Catalogue of Part of the
Library of the late Richard Porson, A.M., Greek Professor of
the University of Cambridge</i>, &amp;c.: sold by auction by Leigh
and Sotheby, June 16th, 1809, 8vo.&mdash;1391 articles: amount of
the books, 1254<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The subjoined is rather a
rich, though brief, specimen of some of the valuable books
contained in the library of this profound Greek scholar; in
whom the acuteness of Bentley, and the erudition of
Hemsterhusius, were more than revived.

<p>Anecdotes and Memoirs of <span class="smcap">Richard Porson</span> are strewn, like
spring flowers in an extensive pasture, in almost every
newspaper, magazine, and journal. Among the latter, there is
an interesting one by Dr. Adam Clarke in the <i>Classical
Journal</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. <span class="smcap">iv.</span>, p. 720. The <i>hand-writing</i> of Porson
is a theme of general admiration, and justly so; but his
<i>Greek</i> characters have always struck me as being more stiff
and cramped than his Roman and Italic. I well remember when
he shewed me, and expatiated eloquently upon, the famous MS.
of Plato, of the 10th century. Poor Fillingham was of the
party. Little did I then expect that three years only would
deprive the world of its great classical ornament, and
myself of a well-informed and gentle-hearted friend! We will
now close our account of the book-ravages in the year 1809,
by noticing the dispersion of a few minor corps of
bibliomaniacal troops, in the shape of printed volumes.
<i>Bibliotheca Maddisoniana: A Catalogue of the extensive and
valuable library of the late</i> <span class="smcap">John Maddison</span>, <i>Esq., of the
foreign department in the Post Office, &amp;c.</i>: sold by auction
by King and Lochée, March, 1809, 8vo. A judicious and
elegant collection. 5239 articles. <span class="smcap">ii.</span> <i>A Catalogue of a
curious, valuable, and rare collection of Books in
Typography, History, Voyages, Early English <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Poetry">Poetvy</span>, Romances, Classics</i>, &amp;c.: the
property of a Collector well known for his literary taste,
&amp;c. Sold by auction by Mr. Stewart, April, 1809, 8vo. Some
curious volumes were in these 1858 articles or lots. <span class="smcap">iii.</span> <i>A
Catalogue of the very valuable and elegant Library of</i>
<span class="smcap">Emperor John Alexander Woodford</span>, Esq., sold by auction by
Leigh and Sotheby, May, 1809, 8vo.&mdash;1773 articles. This was
a sumptuous collection; and the books, in general, brought
large prices, from being sharply contended for. <span class="smcap">iv.</span> <i>A
Catalogue of the interesting and curious historical and
biographical part of the</i> <span class="smcap">Library of a Gentleman</span>,
particularly interesting, during the reign of Elizabeth, the
grand rebellion, the usurpation, restoration, and
abdication, &amp;c., sold by auction by Leigh and Sotheby, in
May, 1809, 8vo. Only 806 articles; but a singularly curious
and elegant collection; the catalogue of which I strongly
recommend to all 'curious, prying, and inquisitive'
bibliomaniacs. The first half of the ensuing year, 1810, was
yet more distinguished for the zeal and energy&mdash;shall I say
<span class="smcap">madness</span>?&mdash;displayed at <span class="smcap">Book-Auctions</span>. The sale of Mr.
Gough's books excited an unusual ferment among English
antiquaries: but the sale of a more extensive, and truly
beautifully classical, collection in Pall Mall, excited
still stronger sensations. As the <i>prices</i> for some of the
articles sold in the Gough collection have already been
printed in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. lxxx., pt. ii.,
and as those for which some of the <i>latter</i> collection were
sold, appeared in the 4th number of <i>The Classical Journal</i>,
it only remains for me to subjoin the following account. <span class="smcap">i.</span>
<i>A Catalogue of the entire and valuable Library (with the
exception of the department of Topography, bequeathed to the
Bodleian Library) of that eminent antiquary</i>, <span class="smcap">Richard Gough</span>,
Esq., deceased, &amp;c., sold by auction by Leigh and Sotheby,
April, 1810, 8vo.&mdash;4082 articles. The <span class="smcap">Manuscripts</span> conclude
the catalogue, at n<span class="super">o</span>. 4373. Prefixed to the printed
books, there is an account of the collector, Mr. Gough,
executed by the faithful pen of Mr. Nichols. My own humble
opinion of this celebrated antiquary has already been before
the public: <i>Typog. Antiquit.</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">i.</span>, 21. <span class="smcap">ii.</span> <i>A
Catalogue of books containing all the rare, useful, and
valuable publications in every department of Literature,
from the first invention of Printing to the present time,
all of which are in the most perfect condition, &amp;c.</i>: sold
by auction by Mr. Jeffery, May, 1810, 8vo.&mdash;4809 articles.
Another Catalogue of the same collection, elegantly printed
in royal octavo, but omitting the auctioneer's notices of
the relative value of certain editions, was published by Mr.
Constable of Edinburgh, bookseller: with the prices and
purchasers' names subjoined: and of which it is said only
250 copies are printed. The <span class="smcap">Rev. Mr. Heath</span> is reported to
have been the owner of this truly select and sumptuous
classical library: the sale of which produced 9000<i>l.</i> Never
did the bibliomaniac's eye alight upon 'sweeter copies'&mdash;as
the phrase is; and never did the bibliomaniacal barometer
rise higher than at this sale! The most marked phrensy
characterized it. A copy of the Editio Princeps of Homer (by
no means a first-rate one) brought 92<i>l.</i>: and all the
<span class="smcap">Aldine Classics</span> produced such an electricity of sensation
that buyers stuck at nothing to embrace them! Do not let it
hence be said that <i>black-letter lore</i> is the only
fashionable pursuit of the present age of book-collectors.
This sale may be hailed as the omen of better and brighter
prospects in Literature in general: and many a useful
philological work, although printed in the Latin or Italian
language&mdash;and which had been sleeping, unmolested, upon a
bookseller's shelf these dozen years&mdash;will now start up from
its slumber, and walk abroad in a new atmosphere, and be
noticed and 'made much of.'
</p><p>
Here I terminate my <i>annotation labours</i> relating to
<span class="smcap">anecdotes of Book-Collectors</span>, and <span class="smcap">accounts of Book-Auctions</span>.
Unless I am greatly deceived, these labours have not been
thrown away. They may serve, as well to awaken curiosity in
regard to yet further interesting memoranda respecting
scholars, as to shew the progressive value of books, and the
increase of the disease called the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>. Some of the
most curious volumes in English literature have in these
notes, been duly recorded; nor can I conclude such a
laborious, though humble, task, without indulging a fond
hope that this account will be consulted by all those who
make book-collecting their amusement. But it is now time to
rise up, with the company described in the text, and to put
on my hat and great-coat. So I make my bow, wishing, with
<i>L'Envoy</i> at the close of <span class="smcap">Marmion</span>,</p>

of value or importance, which were sold in the mean time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I thank you for stopping me: for I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span> hoarse as well as
stupid: I consider the foregoing only as the greater stars or
constellations in the bibliographical hemisphere. Others were less
observed from their supposed comparative insignificancy; although, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
you had attended the auctions, you would have found in them many very
useful, and even rare and splendid, productions. But we are all</p>

<p class="center">'Tickled with the whistling of a name!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> Ay, and naturally enough too. If I look at my Stubbes's
<i>Anatomy of Abuses</i>, which has received <i>your abuse</i> this evening, and
fancy that the leaves have been turned over by the scientific hand of
Pearson, Farmer, or Steevens, I experience, by association of ideas, a
degree of happiness which I never could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span> enjoyed had I obtained
the volume from an unknown collector's library.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Very true; and yet you have only Master Stubbes's work after
all!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> Even so. But this <i>fictitious</i> happiness, as you would call it,
is, in effect, <i>real</i> happiness; inasmuch as it produces positive
sensations of delight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Well, there is no arguing with such a bibliomaniac as yourself,
Lorenzo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> But allow, brother, that this degree of happi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>ness, of which
you boast, is not quite so exquisite as to justify the very high terms
of purchase upon which it is often times procured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> There is no such thing as the 'golden mediocrity' of Horace in
book pursuits. Certain men set their hearts upon certain copies, and
'<i>coûte qu'il coûte</i>'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span> they must secure them. Undoubtedly, I would
give not a little for Parker's own copy of the Book of <i>Common
Prayer</i>, and Shakspeare's own copy of both parts of his <i>Henry the
Fourth</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Well, Lisardo, we stand no chance of stemming the torrent
against two such lusty and opiniated bibliomaniacs as my brother and
Lysander: although I should speak with deference of, and acknowledge
with grateful respect, the extraordinary exertions of the latter, this
evening, to amuse and instruct us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> This evening?&mdash;&mdash;say, this day:&mdash;this live-long day&mdash;and
yesterday also! But have you quite done, dear Lysander?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Have you the conscience to ask for more? I have brought you
down to the year of our Lord <i>One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span> thousand eight hundred and eleven</i>;
and without touching upon the collections of <span class="smcap">living Bibliomaniacs</span>, or
foretelling what may be the future ravages of the Bibliomania in the
course of only the next dozen years, I think it proper to put an end
to my <span class="smcap">Book-Collecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span> History</span>, and more especially to this long trial
of your auricular patience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> A thousand thanks for your exertions! Although your friend,
with whom you are on a visit, knows pretty well the extent of my
bibliographical capacity, and that there have been many parts in your
narrative which were somewhat familiar to me, yet, upon the whole,
there has been a great deal more of novelty, and, in this novelty, of
solid instruction. Sincerely, therefore Lysander, I here offer you my
heart-felt thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I receive them as cordially: from an assurance that my
digressions have been overlooked; or, if noticed, forgiven. It would
be gross vanity, and grosser falsehood, to affirm that the discourse
of this day, on my part, has given anything like a full and explicit
history of all the most eminent book-collectors and patrons of
Learning which have reflected such lustre upon the literary annals of
our country:&mdash;No, Lorenzo: a complete account, or a perfect
description, of these illustrious characters would engage a
conversation, not for one day&mdash;but one week. Yet I have made the most
of the transient hour, and, by my enthusiasm, have perhaps atoned for
my deficiency of information.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> But cannot you resume this conversation on the morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> My stay with our friend is short, and I know not how he means
to dispose of me to-morrow. But I have done&mdash;certainly done&mdash;with
<i>Personal History</i>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> That may be. Yet there are other departments of the Bibliomania
which may be successfully discussed. The weather will probably be
fine, and let us enjoy a morning <i>conversazione</i> in <span class="smcap">the Alcove</span>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> Surely, Lysander may find something in the fruitful
pigeon-holes of his imagination&mdash;as the Abbè Sieyes used to do&mdash;from
which he may draw forth some system or other?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> You have all talked loudly and learnedly of the <span class="smcap">Book-Disease</span>;
but I wish to know whether a <i>mere collector</i> of books be a
bibliomaniac?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Certainly not. There are <span class="smcap">Symptoms</span> of this disease <i>within the
very books themselves</i> of a bibliomaniac.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> And pray what are these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Alas, madam!&mdash;why are you so unreasonable? And how, after
knowing that I have harrangued for more than 'seven hours by
Westminster clock'&mdash;how can you have the conscience to call upon me to
protract the oration? The night has already melted into morning; and I
suppose grey twilight is discoverable upon the summit of the hills. I
am exhausted; and long for repose. Indeed, I must wish you all a good
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> But you promise to commence your <i>symptomatic</i> harangue on the
morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> If my slumbers are sound, lady fair, and I rise tolerably
recruited in strength, I will surely make good my promise. Again, good
night!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> Sir, a very good night: and let our best thanks follow you to
your pillow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Remember, as you sink to repose, what a quantity of good you

<p>Here the company broke up. Lisardo slept at Lorenzo's. Philemon and
Lysander accompanied me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span> my home; and as we past Lorenzo's outer
gate, and looked backward upon the highest piece of rising ground, we
fancied we saw the twilight of morning. Never was a mortal more
heartily thanked for his colloquial exertions than was Lysander. On
reaching home, as we separated for our respective chambers, we shook
hands most cordially; and my eloquent guest returned the squeeze, in a
manner which seemed to tell that he had no greater happiness at heart
than that of finding a reciprocity of sentiment among those whom he
tenderly esteemed. At this moment, we could have given to each other
the choicest volume in our libraries; and I regretted that I had not
contrived to put my black-morocco copy of the small <i>Aldine Petrarch,
printed upon</i> <span class="smcap">vellum</span>, under Lysander's pillow, as a 'Pignus
Amicitiæ.'&mdash;But we were all to assemble together in Lorenzo's <span class="smcap">Alcove</span>
on the morrow; and this thought gave me such lively pleasure that I
did not close my eyes 'till the clock had struck five. Such are the
bed-luxuries of a Bibliomaniac!</p>

blew the breeze, and merrily sung the lark, when Lisardo
quitted his bed-chamber at seven in the morning, and rang lustily at
my outer gate for admission. So early a visitor put the whole house in
commotion; nor was it without betraying some marks of peevishness and
irritability that, on being informed of his arrival, I sent word by
the servant to know what might be the cause of such an interruption.
The reader will readily forgive this trait of harshness and
precipitancy, on my part, when he is informed that I was then just
enjoying the "honey dew" of sleep, after many wakeful and restless
hours.</p>

<p>Lisardo's name was announced: and his voice, conveyed in the sound of
song-singing, from the bottom of the garden, left the name of the
visitor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span> no longer in doubt. I made an effort, and sprung from my bed;
and, on looking through the venetian blinds, I discovered our young
bibliomaniacal convert with a book sticking out of his pocket, another
half opened in his hand (upon which his eyes were occasionally cast),
and a third kept firmly under his left arm. I thrust my head,
"night-cap, tassel and all," out of window, and hailed him; not,
however, before a delicious breeze, wafted over a bed of mignonette,
had electrified me in a manner the most agreeable imaginable.</p>

<p class="bp">Lisardo heard, and hailed me in return. His eyes sparkled with joy;
his step was quick and elastic; and an unusual degree of animation
seemed to pervade his whole frame. "Here," says he, "here is <i>The
British Bibliographer</i><a name="FNanchor_414_420" id="FNanchor_414_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_420" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> in my hand, a volume of Mr. Beloe's
<i>Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books</i> in my pocket, while
another, of Mr. D'Israeli's <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>, is kept
snugly under my arm, as a corps de reserve, or rallying point. If
these things savour not of bibliography, I must despair of ever
attaining to the exalted character of a Bibliomaniac!"</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p class="tp">This discourse awakened my friends, Lysander and Philemon; who each,
from different rooms, put their heads out of window, and hailed the
newly-risen sun with night caps which might have been mistaken for
Persian turbans. Such an unexpected sight caused Lisardo to burst out
into a fit of laughter, and to banter my guests in his usual strain of
vivacity. But on our promising him that we would speedily join his
peripatetic bibliographical reveries, he gave a turn towards the left,
and was quickly lost in a grove of Acacia and Laurustinus. For my
part, instead of keeping this promise, I instinctively sought my bed;
and found the observation of Franklin,&mdash;of air-bathing being
favourable to slumber,&mdash;abundantly verified&mdash;for I was hardly settled
under the clothes 'ere I fell asleep: and, leaving my guests to make
good their appointment with my visitor, I enjoyed a sweet slumber of
more than two hours.</p>

<p>As early rising produces a keen appetite for bodily, as well as
mental, gratification, I found my companions clamorous for their
breakfast. A little before ten o'clock, we were all prepared to make a
formal attack upon muffins, cake, coffee, tea, eggs, and cold tongue.
The window was thrown open; and through the branches of the clustering
vine, which covered the upper part of it, the sun shot a warmer ray;
while the spicy fragrance from surrounding parterres, and jessamine
bowers, made even such bibliomaniacs as my guests forgetful of the
gaily-coated volumes which surrounded them. At length the conversation
was systematically commenced on the part of Lysander.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> To-morrow, Philemon and myself take our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span> departure. We would
willingly have staid the week; but business of a pressing nature calls
<i>him</i> to Manchester&mdash;and <i>myself</i> to Bristol and Exeter.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Some bookseller,<a name="FNanchor_418_424" id="FNanchor_418_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_424" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> I warrant, has published a thumping
catalogue at each of these places. Ha!&mdash;here I have you, sober-minded
Lysander! You are as arrant a book-madman as any of those renowned
bibliomaniacs whom you celebrated yesterday evening!&mdash;Yet, if you love
me, take me with you! My pistoles are not exhausted.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_418_424" id="Footnote_418_424"></a><a href="#FNanchor_418_424">[418]</a> I ought to have noticed, under Lysander's
eulogy upon <i>London Booksellers</i> (see <a href="#Page_308">p. 308</a>, ante) the very
handsome manner in which Mr. Roscoe alludes to their
valuable catalogues&mdash;as having been of service to him in
directing his researches into foreign literature. His words
are these: "The rich and extensive Catalogues published by
<span class="smcap">Edwards</span>, <span class="smcap">Payne</span>, and other <i>London Booksellers</i>, who have of
late years diligently sought for, and imported into England,
whatever is curious or valuable in foreign literature, have
also contributed to the success of my inquiries." <i>Lorenzo
de Medici</i>: pref. p. <span class="smcap">xxvii.</span>, edit. 1800, 8vo.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Peace, Lisardo!&mdash;but you are, in truth, a bit of a prophet. It
is even as you surmise. We have each received a forwarded letter,
informing us of very choice and copious collections of books about to
be sold at these respective places. While I take my departure for Mr.
Ford of Manchester, Lorenzo is about to visit the book-treasures of
Mr. Dyer of Exeter, and Mr. Gutch of Bristol:&mdash;but, indeed, were not
this the case, our abode here must terminate on the morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I suppose the names you have just mentioned describe the
principal booksellers at the several places you intend visiting.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Even so: yet I will make no disparaging comparisons.<a name="FNanchor_419_425" id="FNanchor_419_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_425" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> We
speak only of what has come within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span> our limited experience. There may
be many brave and sagacious bibliopolists whose fame has not reached
our ears, nor perhaps has any one of the present circle ever heard of
the late Mr. Miller of Bungay;<a name="FNanchor_420_426" id="FNanchor_420_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_426" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> who, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span> remember my father to
have said, in spite of blindness and multifarious occupations,
attached himself to the book-selling trade with inconceivable ardour
and success. But a word, Lisardo!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_419_425" id="Footnote_419_425"></a><a href="#FNanchor_419_425">[419]</a> Lysander is right. Since the note upon Mr.
Ford's catalogue of 1810 was written (see <a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>, ante), the
same bookseller has put forth another voluminous catalogue,
of nine thousand and odd articles; forming, with the
preceding, 15,729 lots. This is doing wonders for a
provincial town; and that a <i>commercial</i> one!! Of Mr.
Gutch's spirit and enterprise some mention has been made
before at <a href="#Page_404">p. 404</a>, ante. He is, as yet, hardly <i>mellowed</i> in
his business; but a few years only will display him as
thoroughly <i>ripened</i> as any of his brethren. He comes from a
worthy stock; long known at our <i>Alma Mater
Oxoniensis</i>:&mdash;and as a dutiful son of my University Mother,
and in common with every one who is acquainted with his
respectable family, I wish him all the success which he
merits. Mr. George Dyer of Exeter is a distinguished
<i>veteran</i> in the book-trade: his catalogue of 1810, in two
parts, containing 19,945 articles, has, I think, never been
equalled by that of any provincial bookseller, for the value
and singularity of the greater number of the volumes
described in it. As Lysander had mentioned the foregoing
book-vending gentlemen, I conceived myself justified in
<i>appending</i> this note. I could speak with pleasure and
profit of the catalogues of booksellers to the <i>north of the
Tweed</i>&mdash;(see<a href="#Page_415"> p. 415</a>, ante); but for fear of awaking all the
frightful passions of wrath, jealousy, envy&mdash;I stop:
declaring, from the bottom of my heart, in the language of
an auld northern bard:</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_420_426" id="Footnote_420_426"></a><a href="#FNanchor_420_426">[420]</a> There is something so original in the
bibliomanical character of the above-mentioned Mr. Miller
that I trust the reader will forgive my saying a word or two
concerning him. Thomas Miller of Bungay, in Suffolk, was
born in 1731, and died in 1804. He was put apprentice to a
grocer in Norwich: but neither the fragrance of spices and
teas, nor the lusciousness of plums and figs, could seduce
young Miller from his darling passion of reading, and of
buying odd volumes of the <i>Gentleman's</i> and <i>Universal
Magazine</i> with his spare money. His genius was, however,
sufficiently versatile to embrace both trades; for in 1755,
he set up for himself in the character of <i>Grocer</i> and
<i>Bookseller</i>. I have heard Mr. Otridge, of the Strand,
discourse most eloquently upon the brilliant manner in which
Mr. Miller conducted his complicated concerns; and which,
latterly, were devoted entirely to the <i>Bibliomania</i>.
Although Bungay was too small and obscure for a spirit like
Miller's to disclose its full powers, yet he continued in it
till his death; and added a love of portrait and coin, to
that of book, collecting. <img src="images/miller.png" width="195" height="195" alt="Miller" title="Miller" class="floatr" />
For fifty years his stock, in
these twin departments, was copious and respectable; and
notwithstanding total blindness, which afflicted him during
the last six years of his life, he displayed uncommon
cheerfulness, activity, and even skill in knowing where the
different classes of books were arranged in his shop. Mr.
Miller was a warm loyalist, and an enthusiastic admirer of
Mr. Pitt. In 1795, when provincial copper coins were very
prevalent, our bibliomaniac caused a die of himself to be
struck; intending to strike some impressions of it upon gold
and silver, as well as upon copper. He began with the
latter; and the die breaking when only 23 impressions were
struck off, Miller, in the true spirit of numismatical
<i>virtû</i>, declined having a fresh one made. View here, gentle
reader, a wood-cut taken from the same: "This coin, which is
very finely engraved, and bears a strong profile likeness of
himself, is known to collectors by the name of '<span class="smcap">The Miller
Halfpenny</span>.' Mr. Miller was extremely careful into whose
hands the impressions went; and they are now become so rare
as to produce at sales from three to five guineas."

not a more useful, or a more desirable branch of education

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> From the bottom of mine, I congratulate you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span> Lysander, upon the
resuming of your wonted spirits! I had imagined that the efforts of
yesterday would have completely exhausted you. How rapturously do I
look forward for the <span class="smcap">Symptoms of the Bibliomania</span> to be told this
morning in Lorenzo's <span class="smcap">Alcove</span>! You have not forgotten your promise!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> No, indeed; but if I am able to do justice to the elucidation
of so important a subject, it will be in consequence of having enjoyed
a placid, though somewhat transient, slumber: notwithstanding the
occurrence of a very uncommon <i>dream</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> "I dreamt a dream last night;" which has been already told&mdash;but
what was yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Nay, it is silly to entertain one another with stories of
phantastic visions of the night. I have known the most placid-bosomed
men grow downright angry at the very introduction of such a discourse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> That may be; but we have, luckily, no such <i>placidly-moulded</i>
bosoms in the present society. I love this sort of gossipping during
breakfast, of all things. If our host permit, do give us your dream,
Lysander!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> The dream!&mdash;The dream!&mdash;I entreat you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I fear you will fall asleep, and dream yourself, before the
recital of it be concluded. But I will get through it as well as I
can.</p>

<p>Methought I was gently lifted from the ground into the air by a being
of very superior size, but of an inexpressible sweetness of
countenance. Although astonished by the singularity of my situation, I
was far from giving way entirely to fear; but, with a mixture of
anxiety and resignation, awaited the issue of the event. My Guide or
Protector (for so this being must now be called) looked upon me with
an air of tenderness, mingled with reproof; intimating, as I
conceived, that the same superior Power, which had thus transported me
above my natural element, would of necessity keep me in safety. This
quieted my apprehensions.</p>

<p>We had travelled together through an immensity of space, and could
discover the world below as one small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span> darkened spot, when my Guide
interrupted the awful silence that had been preserved, by the
following exclamation: "Approach, O man, the place of thy
destination&mdash;compose thy perturbed spirits, and let all thy senses be
awakened to a proper understanding of the scene which thou art about
to behold." So saying, he moved along with an indescribable velocity;
and while my eyes were dazzled by an unusual effulgence of light, I
found myself at rest upon a solid seat&mdash;formed of crystal, of
prodigious magnitude.</p>

<p>My guide then fixed himself at my right hand, and after a vehement
ejaculation, accompanied by gestures, which had the effect of
enchantment upon me, he extended a sceptre of massive gold, decorated
with emeralds and sapphires. Immediately there rose up a <span class="smcap">Mirror</span> of
gigantic dimensions, around which was inscribed, in fifty languages,
the word "<span class="smcap">Truth</span>." I sat in mute astonishment. "Examine," said my
Guide, with a voice the most encouraging imaginable, "examine the
objects reflected upon the surface of this mirror." "There are none
that are discernible to my eyes," I replied. "Thou shalt soon be
gratified then," resumed this extraordinary being (with a severe smile
upon his countenance), "but first let me purge thine eyes from those
films of prejudice which, in the world you inhabit, are apt to
intercept the light of <span class="smcap">Truth</span>." He then took a handful of aromatic
herbs, and, rubbing them gently upon my temples, gave me the power of
contemplating, with perfect discernment, the objects before me.</p>

<p>Wonderful indeed was this scene: for upon the surface of the <span class="smcap">Mirror</span>
the whole world seemed to be reflected! At first, I could not controul
my feelings: but, like a child that springs forward to seize an object
greatly beyond its grasp, I made an effort to leave my seat, and to
<i>mingle</i> in the extraordinary scene. Here, however, my guide
interfered&mdash;and, in a manner the most peremptory and decisive, forbade
all further participation of it. "<i>View</i> it attentively," replied he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
"and impress firmly on thy memory what thou shalt see&mdash;it may solace
thee the remainder of thy days."</p>

<p>The authoritative air, with which these words were delivered, quite
repressed and unnerved me. I obeyed, and intently viewed the objects
before me. The first thing that surprised me was the representation of
all the metropolitan cities of Europe. London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin,
and Petersburg, in particular, occupied my attention; and, what was
still <i>more</i> surprising, I seemed to be perfect master of every event
going on in them&mdash;but more particularly of the transactions of <i>Bodies
Corporate</i>. I saw Presidents in their chairs, with Secretaries and
Treasurers by their sides; and to whatever observations were made the
most implicit attention was paid. Here, an eloquent Lecturer was
declaiming upon the beauty of morality, and the deformity of vice:
there, a scientific Professor was unlocking the hidden treasures of
nature, and explaining how Providence, in all its measures, was
equally wonderful and wise. The experiments which ensued, and which
corroborated his ingenious and profound remarks, suspended a
well-informed audience in rapturous attention; which was followed by
instinctive bursts of applause.</p>

<p>Again I turned my eyes, and, contiguous to this scene, viewed the
proceedings of two learned sister Societies, distinguished for their
labours in <i>Philosophy</i> and <i>Antiquity</i>. Methought I saw the spirits
of <span class="smcap">Newton</span> and of <span class="smcap">Dugdale</span>, looking down with complacency upon them, and
congratulating each other upon the <i>general</i> progress of civilization
since they had ceased to mingle among men. "These institutions,"
observed my Guide, "form the basis of rational knowledge, and are the
source of innumerable comforts: for the <i>many</i> are benefitted by the
researches and experiments of the <i>few</i>. It is easy to laugh at such
societies, but it is not quite so easy to remedy the inconveniences
which would be felt, if they were extinct. Nations become powerful in
proportion to their wisdom; it has uniformly been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span> found that where
philosophers lived, and learned men wrote, there the arts have
flourished, and heroism and patriotism have prevailed. True it is that
discrepancies will sometimes interrupt the harmony of public bodies.
But why is perfection to be expected, where every thing must
necessarily be imperfect? It is the duty of man to make the <i>nearest
approaches</i> to public and private happiness. And if, as with a sponge,
he wipe away such establishments, genius has little incentive to
exertion, and merit has still less hope of reward. Now cast your eyes
on a different scene."</p>

<p>I obeyed, and, within the same city, saw a great number of Asylums and
Institutions for the ignorant and helpless. I saw youth instructed,
age protected, the afflicted comforted, and the diseased cured. My
emotions at this moment were wonderfully strong&mdash;they were perceived
by my guide, who immediately begged of me to consider the manner by
which <i>epidemic maladies</i> were prevented or alleviated, and especially
how <i>the most fatal of them</i> had been arrested in its progress. I
attentively examined the objects before me, and saw thousands of
smiling children and enraptured mothers walking confidently 'midst
plague and death! I saw them, happy in the protection which had been
afforded them by the most useful and most nutritious of animals!
"Enough," exclaimed my guide, "thou seest here the glorious result of
a philosophical mind, gifted with unabatable ardour of experiment.
Thou wilt acknowledge that, compared with the triumph which <span class="smcap">such a
mind</span> enjoys, the conquests of heroes are puerile, and the splendour of
monarchy is dim!" During this strain, I fancied I could perceive the
human being, alluded to by my guide, retire apart in conversation with
another distinguished friend of humanity, by those unwearied exertions
the condition of many thousand poor people had been meliorated.</p>

<p>"There is yet," resumed my guide, "another scene equally interesting
as the preceding. From a pure morality flows a pure religion: look
therefore on those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span> engaged in the services of <span class="smcap">Christianity</span>." I
looked, and saw a vast number of my fellow-creatures prostrate in
adoration before their Creator and Redeemer. I fancied I could hear
the last strains of their hallelujahs ascending to the spot whereon I
sat. "Observe," said my Protector, "all do not worship in the same
manner, because all assent not to the same creed; but the intention of
each may be pure: at least, common charity teaches us thus to think,
till some open act betray a malignity of principle. Toleration is the
vital spark of religion: arm the latter with the whips of persecution,
and you convert her into a fiend scattering terror and dismay! In your
own country you enjoy a liberty of sentiment beyond every other on the
face of the globe. Learn to be grateful for such an inestimable
happiness."</p>

<p>These words had hardly escaped my guide, when I was irresistibly led
to look on another part of the Mirror where a kind of imperial
magnificence, combined with the severest discipline, prevailed. "You
are contemplating," resumed my preternatural Monitor, "one of the most
interesting scenes in Europe. See the effect of revolutionary
commotions! While you view the sable spirit of the last monarch of
France gliding along, at a distance, with an air of sorrow and
indignation; while you observe a long line of legitimate princes,
exiled from their native country, and dependant upon the contributions
of other powers; mark the wonderful, the unparalleled reverse of human
events! and acknowledge that the preservation of the finest specimens
of art, the acquisition of every thing which can administer to the
wants of luxury, or decorate the splendour of a throne&mdash;the
acclamations of hired multitudes or bribed senates&mdash;can reflect little
lustre on <span class="smcap">that character</span> which still revels in the frantic wish of
enslaving the world! It is true, you see yonder, Vienna, Petersburg,
Stockholm, and Berlin, bereft of their ancient splendour, and bowing,
as it were, at the feet of a despot&mdash;but had these latter countries
kept alive one spark of that patriotism which so much endears to us
the memories of Greece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span> and Rome&mdash;had they not, in a great measure,
become disunited by factions, we might, even in these days, however
degenerate, have witnessed something like that national energy which
was displayed in the bay of Salamis, and on the plains of Marathon."</p>

<p>My Guide perceiving me to be quite dejected during these remarks,
directed my attention to another part of the Mirror, which reflected
the transactions of the <i>Western</i> and <i>Eastern</i> world.</p>

<p>At first, a kind of <i>mist</i> spread itself upon the glass, and prevented
me from distinguishing any object. This, however, gradually dissolved,
and was succeeded by a thick, black smoke, which involved every thing
in impenetrable obscurity. Just as I was about to turn to my guide,
and demand the explanation of these appearances, the smoke rolled
away, and instantaneously, there flashed forth a thousand bickering
flames. "What," cried I, "is the meaning of these objects?" "Check,
for one moment, your impatience, and your curiosity shall be
gratified," replied my guide. I then distinctly viewed thousands of
<i>Black Men</i>, who had been groaning under the rod of oppression,
starting up in all the transport of renovated life, and shouting aloud
"<span class="smcap">We are free</span>!" One tall commanding figure, who seemed to exercise the
rights of a chieftain among them, gathered many tribes around him, and
addressed them in the following few, but comprehensive, words:
"Countrymen, it has pleased the Great God above to make man
instrumental to the freedom of his fellow-creatures. While we lament
our past, let us be grateful for our present, state: and never let us
cease, each revolving year, to build an altar of stones to the memory,
of that <span class="smcap">great</span> and <span class="smcap">good man</span>, who hath principally been the means of our
<span class="smcap">freedom from slavery</span>. No: we will regularly perform this solemn act,
as long as there shall remain one pebble upon our shores."</p>

<p>"Thus much," resumed my Guide, "for the dawning felicities of the
<i>western</i> world: but see how the <i>eastern</i> empires are yet ignorant
and unsettled!" I was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span> turn my eyes to Persia and India, to
China and Japan, when to my astonishment, the surface of the Mirror
became perfectly blackened, except in some few circular parts, which
were tinged with the colour of blood. "The future is a fearful sight,"
said my Guide; "we are forbidden its contemplation, and can only
behold the gloomy appearances before us: they are ominous ones!"</p>

<p>My mind, on which so many and such various objects had produced a
confused effect, was quite overpowered and distracted. I leaned upon
the arm of the chair, and, covering my face with my hands, became
absorbed in a thousand ideas, when a sudden burst of thunder made me
start from my seat&mdash;and, looking forward, I perceived that the <span class="smcap">Mirror</span>,
with all its magical illusions had vanished away! My preternatural
Guide then placed himself before me, but in an altered female form. A
hundred various coloured wings sprung from her arms, and her feet
seemed to be shod with sandals of rubies; around which numerous
cherubs entwined themselves. The perfume that arose from the flapping
of her wings was inexpressibly grateful; and the soft silvery voices
of these cherubic attendants had an effect truly enchanting.</p>

<p>No language can adequately describe my sensations on viewing this
extraordinary change of object. I gazed with rapture upon my wonderful
Guide, whose countenance now beamed with benevolence and beauty. "Ah!"
exclaimed I, "this is a vision of happiness never to be realized! Thou
art a being that I am doomed never to meet with in the world below."
"Peace:" whispered an unknown voice; "injure not thy species by such a
remark: the object before thee is called by a name that is familiar to
thee&mdash;it is '<span class="smcap">Candour</span>.' She is the handmaid of Truth, the sister of
Virtue, and the priestess of Religion."</p>

<p>I was about to make reply, when a figure of terrific mien, and
enormous dimensions, rushed angrily towards me, and, taking me up in
my crystal chair, bore me precipitately to the earth. In my struggles
to disengage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span> myself, I awoke: and on looking about me, with
difficulty could persuade myself that I was an inhabitant of this
world. My sensations were, at first, confused and unpleasant; but a
reflection on the <span class="smcap">Mirror of Truth</span>, and its divine expositor, in a
moment tranquillized my feelings. And thus have I told you my dream.</p>

<hr class="med" />

<p>Lysander had hardly concluded the recital of his dream&mdash;during which
it was impossible for us to think of quaffing coffee or devouring
muffins&mdash;when the servant entered with a note from Lorenzo:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"My dear Friend,</span></p>

<p class="letter">"The morning is propitious. Hasten to <span class="smcap">the Alcove</span>. My sisters are
twining honey-suckles and jessamine round the portico, and I have
carried thither a respectable corps of bibliographical volumes, for
Lysander to consult, in case his memory should fail. All here invoke
the zephyrs to waft their best wishes to you.</p>

<p class="right"><span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Truly your's,</span></p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Lorenzo</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>The note was no sooner read than we all, as if by instinct, started
up; and, finishing our breakfast as rapidly as did the Trojans when
they expected an early visit from the Grecians, we sallied towards
Lorenzo's house, and entered his pleasure grounds. Nothing could be
more congenial than every circumstance and object which presented
itself. The day was clear, calm, and warm; while a crisp autumnal air</p>

1803; vol x., p. 73. Alain Chartier, in the motto prefixed

given us a yet more animated, and equally characteristic,
picture. Thomson's serene morning,</p>

<p class="center">Unfolding fair the last autumnal day,</p>

<p>is also very apposite; and reminds us of one of those soft
and aërial pictures of Claude Loraine, where a heaven-like
tranquillity and peace seem to prevail. Delightful
scenes!&mdash;we love to steal a short moment from a bustling
world, to gaze upon landscapes which appear to have been
copied from the paradise of our first parents. Delusive yet
fascinating objects of contemplation! You whisper sweet
repose, and heart-soothing delight! We turn back upon the
world; and the stunning noises of Virgil's Cyclops put all
this fair Elysium to flight.</p>

<p class="tp">At a distance, the reapers were carrying away their last harvest load;
and numerous groups of gleaners picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span> up the grain which they had
spared, were marching homewards in all the glee of apparent happiness.
Immediately on our left, the cattle were grazing in a rich pasture
meadow; while, before us, the white pheasant darted across the walk,
and the stock-dove was heard to wail in the grove. We passed a row of
orange trees, glittering with golden fruit; and, turning sharply to
our right, discovered, on a gentle eminence, and skirted with a
profusion of shrubs and delicately shaped trees, the wished-for
<span class="smcap">Alcove</span>.</p>

<p class="bp">We quickly descried Almansa busied in twining her favourite
honey-suckles round the portico; while within Belinda was sitting
soberly at work, as if waiting our arrival. The ladies saluted us as
we approached; and Lorenzo, who till now had been unperceived, came
quietly from the interior, with his favourite edition of
<i>Thomson</i><a name="FNanchor_424_430" id="FNanchor_424_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_430" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> in his hand.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_424_430" id="Footnote_424_430"></a><a href="#FNanchor_424_430">[424]</a> This must be a favourite edition with every
man of taste. It was printed by <span class="smcap">Bensley</span>, and published by <span class="smcap">Du
Roveray</span>, in the year 1802. The designs were by Hamilton, and
the engravings principally by Fittler. The copy which
Lorenzo had in his hand was upon <i>large paper</i>; and nothing
could exceed the lustre of the type and plates. The editions
of <i>Pope</i>, <i>Gray</i>, and <i>Milton</i>, by <span class="smcap">Du Roveray</span>, as well as
those of <i>The Spectator</i>, <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Tatler</i>, by Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Sharpe</span> and <span class="smcap">Hailes</span>, are among the most elegant, as well as
accurate, publications of our old popular writers.</p>

<p class="tbp">The Alcove at a distance, had the appearance of a rustic temple.<a name="FNanchor_425_431" id="FNanchor_425_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_431" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
The form, though a little capricious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span> was picturesque; and it stood
so completely embosomed in rich and variegated foliage, and commanded
so fine a swell of landscape, that the visitor must be cold indeed who
could approach it with the compass of Palladio in one hand, and the
square of Inigo Jones in the other. We entered and looked around us.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_425_431" id="Footnote_425_431"></a><a href="#FNanchor_425_431">[425]</a> Lorenzo was not unmindful that it had been
observed by Lipsius (<i>Syntag. de Bibliothecis</i>) and, after
him, by Thomasinus (<i>de Donar. et Tabell-votiv.</i> c. 3. p.
37.) that the ancients generally built their libraries near
to, or adjoining their <i>Temples</i>; "ut veram seram sedem
sacratorum ingenii fætuum loca sacra esse ostenderent:"
<span class="smcap">Bibliothecas</span> (inquit) procul abesse (sc. a <span class="smcap">Templis</span>)
noluerunt veteres, ut ex præclaris ingeniorum monumentis
dependens mortalium, gloria, in Deorum tutela esset. This I
gather from Spizolius's <i>Infelix Literatus</i>: p. 462.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">Those who have relished the mild beauties of Wynants' pictures would
be pleased with the view from the Alcove of Lorenzo. The country
before was varied, undulating, and the greater part, highly
cultivated. Some broad-spreading oaks here and there threw their
protecting arms round the humble saplings; and some aspiring elms
frequently reared their lofty heads, as land-marks across the county.
The copses skirted the higher grounds, and a fine park-wood covered
the middle part of the landscape in one broad umbrageous tone of
colouring. It was not the close rusticity of Hobbima&mdash;or the
expansive, and sometimes complicated, scenery of Berghem&mdash;or the
heat-oppressive and magnificent views of Both&mdash;that we contemplated;
but, as has been before observed, the mild and gentle scenery of
Wynants; and if a cascade or dimpling brook had been near us, I could
have called to my aid the transparent pencil of Rysdael, in order to
impress upon the reader a proper notion of the scenery. But it is high
time to make mention of the conversation which ensued among the
tenants of this Alcove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> I am heartily glad we are met under such propitious
circumstances. What a glorious day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Have you recovered, Sir, the immense fatigue you must have
sustained from the exertions of yesterday? My brother has no mercy
upon a thoroughly-versed book guest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I am indeed quite hearty: yet, if any thing heavy and
indigested hung about me, would not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span> contemplation of such a
landscape, and such a day, restore every thing to its wonted ardour?!
You cannot conceive how such a scene affects me: even to shedding
tears of pleasure&mdash;from the reflections to which it gives rise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> How strangely and how cruelly has the character of a
bibliographer been aspersed! Last night you convinced me of the ardour
of your enthusiasm, and of the eloquence of your expression, in regard
to your favourite subject of discussion!&mdash;but, this morning, I find
that you can talk in an equally impassioned manner respecting garden
and woodland scenery?</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Yes, Madam: and if I possessed such a domain as does your
brother, I think I could even improve it a little&mdash;especially the
interior of the Alcove! I don't know that I could attach to the house
a more appropriate library than he has done; even if I adopted the
octagonal form of the <i>Hafod Library</i>;<a name="FNanchor_426_432" id="FNanchor_426_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_432" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> which, considered with
reference to its local situation, is, I think, almost unequalled:&mdash;but
it strikes me that the interior of this Alcove might be somewhat
improved.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_426_432" id="Footnote_426_432"></a><a href="#FNanchor_426_432">[426]</a> Hafod, in Cardiganshire, South Wales, is the
residence of <span class="smcap">Thomas Johnes</span>, Esq., M.P., and Lord Lieutenant
of the county. Mr. Malkin, in his <i>Scenery, Antiquities, and
Biography, of South Wales</i>, 1804, 4to., and Dr. Smith, in
his <i>Tour to Hafod</i>, 1810, folio, have made us pretty well
acquainted with the local scenery of Hafod:&mdash;yet can any pen
or pencil do this</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;Paradise, open'd in the wild,</p>

<p>perfect justice! I have seen Mr. Stothard's numerous little
sketches of the pleasure-grounds and surrounding country,
which are at once faithful and picturesque. But what were
this "Paridise" of rocks, waterfalls, streams, woods,
copses, dells, grottos, and mountains, without the
hospitable spirit of the owner&mdash;which seems to preside in,
and to animate, every summer-house and alcove. The
book-loving world is well acquainted with the <i>Chronicles of
Froissart</i>, <i>Joinville</i>, <i>De Brocquiere</i>, and <i>Monstrelet</i>,
which have issued from the <span class="smcap">Hafod Press</span>; and have long
deplored the loss, from fire, which their author, Mr.
Johnes, experienced in the demolition of the greater part of
his house and library. The former has been rebuilt, and the
latter replenished: yet no Ph&#339;nix spirit can revivify the
ashes of those volumes which contained the romances notified
by the renowned Don Quixote! But I am rambling too wildly
among the Hafod rocks&mdash;I hasten, therefore to return and
take the reader with me into the interior of Mr. Johnes's
largest library, which is terminated by a Conservatory of
upwards of 150 feet. As the ancient little books for
children [hight <i>Lac Puerorum</i>!] used to express it&mdash;"Look,
here it is."

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> They are rather omissions to be supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span> than errors to be
corrected. You have warmed the interior by a Grecian-shaped stove, and
you do right; but I think a few small busts in yonder recesses would
not be out of character. Milton, Shakespeare, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span> Locke, would
produce a sort of inspiration which might accord with that degree of

debate&mdash;but the discussion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You wish to know what are the <span class="smcap">symptoms of the
bibliomania</span>?&mdash;what are the badges or livery marks, in a library, of
the owner of the collection being a bibliomaniac?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Even so. My question, yesterday evening, was&mdash;if I remember
well&mdash;whether a <i>mere collector</i> of books was necessarily a
bibliomaniac?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Yes: and to which&mdash;if I also recollect rightly&mdash;I replied that
the symptoms of the disease, and the character of a bibliomaniac, were
discoverable in the very books themselves!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> How is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman &amp; Belin.</span> Do pray let us hear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> At the outset, I entreat you, Lysander, not to overcharge the
colouring of your picture. Respect the character of your auditors;
and, above all things, have mercy upon the phlogistic imagination of
Lisardo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I will endeavour to discharge the important office of a
bibliomaniacal Mentor, or, perhaps, Æsculapius, to the utmost of my
power: and at all events, with the best possible intentions.</p>

<p class="bp">Before we touch upon the <i>Symptoms</i>, it may be as well to say a few
words respecting the <i>General Character</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span> the <span class="smcap">Book Disease</span>. The
ingenious Peignot<a name="FNanchor_427_433" id="FNanchor_427_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_433" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> defines the bibliomania to be "a passion for
possessing books; not so much to be instructed by them, as to gratify
the eye by looking on them." This subject has amused the pens of
foreigners; although we have had nothing in our own language, written
expressly upon it, 'till the ingenious and elegantly-composed poem of
Dr. Ferriar appeared; after which, as you well know, our friend put
forth his whimsical brochure.<a name="FNanchor_428_434" id="FNanchor_428_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_434" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

est la fureur de posséder des livres, non pas
tant pour s'instruire, que pour les avoir et pour en
repaître sa vue. Le bibliomane ne connait ordinairement les
livres que par leur titre, leur frontispice, et leur date;
il s'attache aux bonnes editiones et les poursuit à quelque
titre que ce soit; la relieure le seduit aussi, soit par son

see also the extracts from the <i>Memoires de l'Institut</i>:

to call the <span class="smcap">bibliomania</span> by every caustic and merciless
terms: thus speaks the hard-hearted Geyler: "Tertia nola

<p>There is a short, but smart and interesting, article on this
head in Mr. D'Israeli's <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>: vol. i.
10. "Bruyere has touched on this mania with humour; of such
a collector (one who is fond of superb bindings only), says
he, as soon as I enter his house, I am ready to faint on the
stair-case from a strong smell of Russia and Morocco
leather. In vain he shews me fine editions, gold leaves,
Etruscan bindings, &amp;c.&mdash;naming them one after another, as if
he were shewing a gallery of pictures!" Lucian has composed
a biting invective against an ignorant possessor of a vast
library. "One who opens his eyes with an hideous stare at an
old book; and after turning over the pages, chiefly admires
<i>the date</i> of its publication." But all this, it may be
said, is only general declamation, and means nothing!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_428_434" id="Footnote_428_434"></a><a href="#FNanchor_428_434">[428]</a> The first work, I believe, written expressly
upon the subject above discussed was a French publication,
entitled <i>La Bibliomanie</i>. Of the earliest edition I am
uninformed; but one was published at the Hague in 1762, 8vo.
Dr. Ferriar's poem upon the subject, being an epistle to
Richard Heber, Esq.&mdash;and which is rightly called by Lysander
'ingenious and elegant'&mdash;was published in 1809, 4to.: pp.
14: but not before an equally ingenious, and greatly more
interesting, performance, by the same able pen, had appeared
in the Trans. of the Manchester Literary Society, vol. iv.,
p. 45-87&mdash;entitled <i>Comments upon Sterne</i>; which may be
fairly classed among the species of bibliomaniacal
composition; inasmuch as it shews the author to be well read
in old books; and, of these, in Burton's Anatomy of
Melancholy in particular. Look for half a minute at <a href="#Page_286">p. 286</a>,
ante. In the same year of Dr. Ferriar's publication of the
Bibliomania, appeared the <i>Voyage autour de ma bibliothèque
Roman Bibliographique</i>: by Ant. Caillot; in three small
duodecimo volumes. There is little ingenuity and less
knowledge in these meagre volumes. My own superficial work,
entitled, <i>Bibliomania</i>, or <i>Book-Madness: containing some
account of the History, Symptoms and Cure of this fatal
Disease; in an epistle addressed to Richard Heber, Esq.</i>,
quickly followed Dr. Ferriar's publication. It contained 82
pages, with a tolerably copious sprinkling of notes: but it
had many errors and omissions, which it has been my
endeavour to correct and supply in the present new edition,
or rather newly-constructed work. Vide preface. Early in the
ensuing year (namely, in 1810) appeared <i>Bibliosophia, or
Book-Wisdom: containing some account of the Pride, Pleasure,
and Privileges of that glorious Vocation, Book-Collecting.
By an Aspirant. Also, The Twelve Labours of an Editor,
separately pitted against those of Hercules</i>, 12mo. This is
a good-humoured and tersely written composition: being a
sort of Commentary upon my own performance. In the ensuing
pages will be found some amusing poetical extracts from it.
And thus take we leave of <span class="smcap">Publications upon the
Bibliomania</span>!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>Whether Peignot's definition be just or not, I will not stop to
determine: but when I have described to you the various symptoms, you
will be better able to judge of its propriety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Describe them <i>seriatim</i>, as we were observing yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I will; but let me put them in battle array, and select them
according to their appearances. There is, first, a passion for <i>Large
Paper Copies</i>; secondly, for <i>Uncut Copies</i>; thirdly, for <i>Illustrated
Copies</i>; fourthly, for <i>Unique Copies</i>; fifthly, for <i>Copies printed
upon Vellum</i>; sixthly, for <i>First Editions</i>; seventhly, for <i>True
Editions</i>; and eighthly, for <i>Books printed in the Black-Letter</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> I have put these symptoms down in my pocket-book; and shall
proceed to catechise you according to your own method. First,
therefore, what is meant by <span class="smcap">Large Paper Copies</span>?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> A certain set, or limited number of the work, is printed upon
paper of a <i>larger dimension, and superior quality</i>, than the ordinary
copies. The press-work and ink are, always, proportionably better in
these copies: and the price of them is enhanced according to their
beauty and rarity.</p>

<p><i>This Symptom</i> of the Bibliomania is, at the present day, both general
and violent. Indeed, there is a set of collectors, the shelves of
whose libraries are always made proportionably stout, and placed at a
due distance from each other, in order that they may not break down
beneath the weight of such ponderous volumes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> Can these things be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Yes; but you should draw a distinction, and not confound the
<span class="smcap">Grolliers</span>, De Thous, and Colberts of modern times, with "a set of
collectors," as you call them, who are equally without taste and
knowledge.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> We have heard of De Thou and Colbert, but who is <span class="smcap">Grollier</span>?<a name="FNanchor_429_435" id="FNanchor_429_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_435" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_429_435" id="Footnote_429_435"></a><a href="#FNanchor_429_435">[429]</a> The reader may be better pleased with the
ensuing soberly-written account of this great man than with
Philemon's rapturous eulogy. <span class="smcap">John Grollier</span> was born at
Lyons, in 1479; and very early displayed a propensity
towards those elegant and solid pursuits which afterwards
secured to him the admiration and esteem of his
contemporaries. His address was easy, his manners were
frank, yet polished; his demeanour was engaging, and his
liberality knew no bounds. As he advanced in years, he
advanced in reputation; enjoying a princely fortune, the
result, in some measure, of a faithful and honourable
discharge of the important diplomatic situations which he
filled. He was Grand Treasurer to Francis I., and was sent
by that monarch as ambassador to Pope Clement VII. During
his abode at Rome, he did not fail to gratify his favourite
passion of <span class="smcap">book-collecting</span>; and employed the Alduses to
print for him an edition of Terence in 8vo., 1521: of which
a copy <i>upon vellum</i>, was in the Imperial library at Vienna;
See <i>L'Imp. des Alde</i>; vol. <span class="smcap">i.</span>, 159. He also caused to be
published, by the same printers, an edition of his friend
Budæus's work, <i>De Asse et partibus ejus</i>, 1522, 4to.;
which, as well as the Terence, is dedicated to himself, and
of which the presentation copy, <i>upon vellum</i>, is now in the
Library of Count M'Carthy, at Toulouse: it having been
formerly in the Soubise collection: vide <a href="#Page_96">p. 96</a>, ante&mdash;and
n<span class="super">o</span>. 8010 of the <i>Bibl. Soubise</i>. It was during Grollier's
stay at Rome, that the anecdote, related by Egnatio, took
place. 'I dined (says the latter) along with Aldus, his son,
Manutius, and other learned men, at Grollier's table. After
dinner, and just as the dessert had been placed on the
table, our host presented each of his guests with a pair of
gloves filled with ducats.' But no man had a higher opinion
of Grollier, or had reason to express himself in more
grateful terms of him, than De Thou. This illustrious author
speaks of him as "a man of equal elegance of manners, and
spotlessness of character. His books seemed to be the
counterpart of himself, for neatness and splendour; not
being inferior to the glory attributed to the library of
Asinius Pollio, the first who made a collection of books at
Rome. It is surprising, notwithstanding the number of
presents which he made to his friends, and the accidents
which followed on the dispersion of his library, how many of
his volumes yet adorn the most distinguished libraries of
Paris, whose chief boast consists in having an <i>Exemplar
Grollerianum</i>!" The fact was Grollier returned to Paris with
an immense fortune. During his travels he had secured, from
Basil, Venice, and Rome, the most precious copies of books
which could be purchased: and which he took care to have
bound in a singular manner, indicative at once of his
generosity and taste. The title of the book was marked in
gilt letters upon one side, and the words&mdash;of which the
annexed wood-cut is a fac-simile&mdash;upon the other; surrounded
with similar ornaments to the extremities of the sides,
whether in folio or duodecimo.

<p>This extraordinary man, whom France may consider the first
Bibliomaniac of the sixteenth century, died at Paris in the
year 1565, and in the 86th of his age. Let us close this
account of him with an extract from Marville's <i>Melanges
d'Histoire et de Litérature</i>; "La Bibliothèque de M.
Grollier s'est conservée dans l'Hôtel de Vic jusqu'à ces
annêes dernieres qu'elle a été venduë à l'encan. Elle
meritoit bien, étant une des premieres et des plus
accomplies qu'aucun particulier se soit avisé de faire à
Paris, de trouver, comme celle de M. de Thou, un acheteur
qui en conservât le lustre. La plûpart des curieux de Paris
ont profité de ses débris. J'en ai eu à ma part quelques
volumes à qui rien ne manque: ni pour la bonté des editions
de ce tems là, ni pour la beauté du papier et la propreté de
la relieure. Il semble, à les voir, que les Muses qui ont
contribué à la composition du dedans, se soient aussi
appliquées à les approprier au dehors, tant il paroît d'art
et d'esprit dans leurs ornemens. Ils sont tous dorez avec
une delicatesse inconnuë aux doreurs d'aujourd'hui. Les
compartemens sont pients de diverses couleurs, parfaitemente
bien dessinez, et tous de differentes figures, &amp;c.:" vol.
<span class="smcap">i.</span>, p. 187, edit. 1725. Then follows a description, of which
the reader has just had ocular demonstration. After such an
account, what bibliomaniac can enjoy perfect tranquillity of
mind unless he possess a <i>Grollier copy</i> of some work or
other? My own, from which the preceding fac-simile was
taken, is a folio edition (1531) of <i>Rhenanus, de rebus
Germanicis</i>; in the finest preservation.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span><span class="smcap">Phil</span>. Lysander will best observe upon him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand</span>. Nay; his character cannot be in better hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span>. Grollier was both the friend and the treasurer of Francis the
First; the bosom companion of De Thou, and a patron of the Aldine
family. He had learning, industry, and inflexible integrity. His
notions of <i>Virtû</i> were vast, but not wild. There was a magnificence
about every thing which he did or projected; and his liberality was
without bounds. He was the unrivalled Mecænas of book-lovers and
scholars; and a more insatiable bibliomaniacal appetite was never,
perhaps, possessed by any of <i>his</i> class of character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis</span>. I thank you for this <i>Grollieriana</i>. Proceed, Lysander with your

<p><span class="smcap">Alman</span>. But first tell us&mdash;why are these copies so much coveted? Do

<p>After these saucy attacks, can I venture upon discoursing,
in a sober note-like strain&mdash;upon those large and
magnificent volumes concerning which Lysander, above, pours
forth such a torrent of eloquence? Yes&mdash;gentle reader&mdash;I
will even venture!&mdash;and will lay a silver penny to boot (See
Peacham's '<i>Worth of a Penny</i>'&mdash;) that neither Dr. Ferriar
nor the 'Aspirant' could withhold their ejaculations of

few scarce
</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Works printed upon Large Paper</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lord Bacon's Essays</i>; 1798, 8vo. There were only six copies
of this edition struck off upon royal folio paper: one copy
is in the Cracherode collection, in the British Museum; and
another is in the library of Earl Spencer. Mr. Leigh, the
book-auctioneer, a long time ago observed that, if ever one
of these copies were to be sold at an auction, it would
probably bring -00<i>l.</i>&mdash;! I will not insert the <i>first</i>
figure; but <i>two noughts</i> followed it.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Twenty Plays of
Shakspeare from the old quarto editions</i>; 1766, 8vo., 6
vols. Only twelve copies printed upon large paper. See
<i>Bibl. Steevens</i>: n<span class="super">o</span>. 1312; and <a href="#Page_581">p. 581</a>,
ante.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Dodsley's Collection of Old Plays</i>; 1780, 8vo., 12
vols. Only six copies struck off upon large paper. Bibl.
Woodhouse, n<span class="super">o</span>. 698.&mdash;&mdash;<i>The Grenville Homer</i>; 1800, 4to.,
4 vols. Fifty copies of this magnificent work are said to
have been printed upon large paper; which have
embellishments of plates. Mr. Dent possesses the copy which
was Professor Porson's, and which was bought at the sale of
the Professor's library, in boards, for 87<i>l.</i>, see <a href="#Page_459">p. 459</a>,
ante. Seven years ago I saw a sumptuous copy in morocco,
knocked down for 99<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Mathæi Paris, Monachi
Albanenses, &amp;c.; Historia Major; a Wats</i>; Lond. 1640; folio.
This is a rare and magnificent work upon large paper; and is
usually bound in two volumes.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Historiæ Anglicanæ
Scriptores X; a Twysden</i>; 1652, folio. Of equal rarity and
magnificence are copies of this inestimable
production.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores Veteres, a
Gale</i>; 1684, 91; folio, 3 volumes. There were but few copies
of this, now generally coveted, work printed upon large
paper. The difference between the small and the large, for
amplitude of margin and lustre of ink, is
inconceivable.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Historiæ Anglicanæ Scriptores Varii, a
Sparke</i>; Lond. 1723, folio. The preface to this work shews
that there are copies of it, like those of Dr. Clarke's
edition of Cæsar's Commentaries, upon paper of three
different sizes. The 'charta maxima' is worthy of a
conspicuous place upon the collector's shelf; though in any
shape the book has a creditable aspect.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Recueil des
Historiens des Gaules, &amp;c., par Boucquet</i>; 1738, 1786;
folio, 13 vols. It is hardly possible for the eye to gaze
upon a more intrinsically valuable work, or a finer set of
volumes, than are these, as now exhibited in Mr. Evans's
shop, and bound in fine old red morocco by the best binders
of France. They were once in my possession; but the 'res
angusta domi' compelled me to part with them, and to seek
for a copy not so tall by head and shoulders. Since the year
1786, two additional volumes have been published.
</p>

<p class="center">We will now discourse somewhat of English books.</p>

<p><i>Scott's Discoverie of Whitcraft</i>; 1584, 4to. Of this work,
which has recently become popular from Mr. Douce's frequent
mention of it (Illustrations of Shakspeare, &amp;c., 1806, 2
vols., 8vo.), my friend, Mr. Utterson, possesses a very
beautiful copy upon large paper. It is rarely one meets with
books printed in this country, before the year 1600, struck
off in such a manner. This copy, which is secured from
'winter and rough weather' by a stout coat of
skilfully-tool'd morocco, is probably unique.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Weever's
Funeral Monuments</i>; 1631, folio. Mr. Samuel Lysons informs
me that he has a copy of this work upon large paper. I never
saw, or heard of, another similar one.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Sanford's
Genealogical History</i>; 1707, folio. At the sale of Baron
Smyth's books, in 1809, Messrs. J. and A. Arch purchased a
copy of this work upon large paper for 46<i>l.</i> A monstrous
price! A similar copy is in the library of Mr. Grenville,
which was obtained from Mr. Evans of Pall-Mall. The curious
should purchase the anterior edition (of 1677) for the sake
of better impressions of the plates; which, however, in any
condition, are neither tasteful nor well engraved. What is
called '<i>a good Hollar</i>' would weigh down the whole set of
them!&mdash;&mdash;<i>Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials</i>; 1721, <i>Folio</i>,
3 vols.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Annals of the Reformation</i>; 1725, <i>Folio</i>, 4
vols. Happy the collector who can regale himself by viewing
large paper copies of these inestimable works! In any shape
or condition, they are now rare. The latter is the scarcer
of the two; and upon large paper brings, what the French
bibliographers call, 'un prix enorme.' There is one of this
kind in the beautiful library of Mr. Thomas
Grenville.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Hearne's Works</i>&mdash;'till Mr. Bagster issued his
first reprints of Robert of Gloucester and Peter Langtoft,
upon paper of three different sizes&mdash;(of which the largest,
in quarto, has hardly been equalled in modern
printing)&mdash;used to bring extravagant sums at book-auctions.
At a late sale in Pall-Mall, <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: where">were</span>
the books in general were sold at extraordinary
prices, the large paper Hearnes absolutely 'hung fire'&mdash;as
the sportsman's phrase is.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Hudibras, with Dr. Grey's
Annotations, and Hogarth's cuts</i>; 1744, 2 vols. There were
but twelve copies of this first and best edition of Dr.
Grey's labours upon Hudibras (which Warburton strangely
abuses&mdash;) printed upon large paper: and a noble book it is
in this form!&mdash;&mdash;<i>Milner's History of Winchester</i>; 1798,
4to., 2 vols. Of this edition there were, I believe, either
twelve or twenty-four copies printed upon large paper; which
brings serious sums in the present general rage for books of
this description.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Kennet's (Bp.) Parochial Antiquities;
Oxford</i>, 1695, 4to. The only known copy of this work upon
large paper is in the fine library of Sir Richard Colt
Hoare, Bart. This copy was probably in the collection of
'that well-known collector, Joseph Browne, Esq., of Shepton
Mallet, Somersetshire:' as a similar one 'in Russia, gilt
leaves,' was sold in Pt. II. of his collection, n<span class="super">o</span>. 279,
for 7<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and purchased in the name of
Thornton.&mdash;&mdash;<i>The Chronicles of Froissart and Monstrelet</i>:
translated by Thomas Johnes, Esq. Hafod, 1803, 1810, quarto,
9 vols.: including a volume of plates to Monstrelet. Of
these beautiful and intrinsically valuable works, there were
only 25 copies struck off upon folio; which bring tremendous
prices.&mdash;&mdash;<i>History of the Town of Cheltenham, and its
Environs</i>; 1802, 8vo. There were a few copies of this
superficial work printed upon large paper in royal octavo,
and a <i>unique</i> copy upon paper of a quarto size; which
latter is in the possession of my friend Mr. Thomas Pruen,
of the same place. A part of this volume was written by
myself; according to instructions which I received to make
it 'light and pleasant.' An author, like a barrister, is
bound in most cases to follow his instructions! As I have
thus awkwardly introduced myself, I may be permitted to
observe, at the foot of this note, that all the <span class="smcap">large paper</span>
copies of my own humble lucubrations have been attended with
an unexpectedly successful sale. Of the <i>Introduction to the
Classics</i>, edit. 1804, 8vo., there were fifty copies, with
extra plates, struck off in royal octavo, and published at
2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>: these now sell for 5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>: the portrait of
<i>Bishop Fell</i> making them snapped at, with a perch-like
spirit, by all true Grangerites. Of the <i>Typographical
Antiquities</i> of our own country there were 66 printed in a
superb style, upon imperial paper, in 4to.; these were
published at 6<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> a copy. The following anecdote
shews how they are 'looking up'&mdash;as the book-market phrase
is. My friend &mdash;&mdash; parted with his copy; but finding that his
slumbers were broken, and his dreams frightful, in
consequence, he sought to regain possession of it; and
cheerfully gave 10<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>! for what, but a few months
before, he had possessed for little more than one half the
sum! The same friend subscribes for a <i>large paper</i> of the
<i>present work</i>, of which there are only eighteen copies
printed: and of which my hard-hearted printer and myself
seize each upon a copy. Will the same friend display equal
fickleness in regard to <span class="smcap">this</span> volume? If he does, he must
smart acutely for it: nor will 15<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> redeem it! It
is justly observed, in the first edition of this work, that,
'analogous to large paper, are <span class="smcap">tall</span> copies: that is, copies
of the work published on the ordinary size paper, and barely
cut down by the binder,' p. 45. To <i>dwarfise</i> a volume is a
'grievous fault' on the part of any binder; but more
particularly is it an unpardonable one on the part of him
who has had a long intercourse with professed bibliomaniacs!
To a person who knows anything of typographical arrangement,
the distinction between <i>tall</i> and <i>large paper</i> copies is
sufficiently obvious. For this reason, I am quite decided
that the supposed large paper copy of <i>Scapula's Lexicon</i>,
possessed by Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, of Caversham, near Reading, is only a
<i>tall</i> copy of the work, as usually printed: nor is this
copy more stately than another which I have seen. The owner
of the volume will suppress all feelings which he may
entertain against my heretical opinions (as I fear he will
call them), when he considers that he may dispose of his
Scapula for a sum three times beyond what he gave for it.
Let him put it by the side of his neighbour Dr. Valpy's
numerous large paper copies of the old folio classics, and
he will in a moment be convinced of the accuracy of the
foregoing remark. <span class="smcap">Fine paper</span> copies of a work should be here
noticed; as they are sought after with avidity. The most
beautiful work of this kind which I ever saw, was <i>Rapin's
History of England, in nine folio volumes, bound in red

M.M. Sykes recently purchased of Mr. Evans, the
bookseller,&mdash;for a comparatively moderate sum. A similar
copy (exclusively of the illustrations) of Rapin's History
of England, which was once in the library of the Royal
Institution, was burnt in the fire that destroyed
Covent-Garden Theatre; it having been sent to Mr. Mackinlay,
the book-binder, who lived near the Theatre.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I have little to add to what has been already said of this
symptom. That a volume, so published, has a more pleasing aspect,
cannot be denied. It is the oak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span> in its full growth, compared with
the same tree in its sapling state: or, if you please, it is the same
picture a little more brilliant in its colouring, and put into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
handsomer frame. My friend <span class="smcap">Marcus</span> is a very dragon in this department
of book-collecting: nothing being too formidable for his attack. Let
the volume assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span> what shape it may, and let the price be ever so
unconscionable&mdash;he hesitates not to become a purchaser. In
consequence, exclusively of all the <i>Dugdales</i> and <i>Montfaucons</i>, upon
large paper, and in the finest bindings, he possesses the <i>Grand Folio
Classics</i>, the <i>Benedictine Editions of the Fathers</i>, the <i>County
Histories</i>, and all works, of a recent date, upon <i>History</i> and the
<i>Belles Lettres</i>. In short, nothing can be more magnificent than the
interior of his library; as nothing but giants, arrayed in the most
splendid attire, are seen to keep guard from one extremity of the room
to the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis</span>. Who is this Marcus? I'll rival him in due time!&mdash;But proceed.</p>

most extraordinary.<a name="FNanchor_431_437" id="FNanchor_431_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_437" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> It may be defined a passion to possess books
of which the edges have never been sheared by the binder's tools. And
here I find myself walking upon doubtful ground:&mdash;your friend [turning
towards me] Atticus's <i>uncut Hearnes</i> rise up in "rough majesty"
before me, and almost "push me from my stool." Indeed, when I look
around in your book-lined tub, I cannot but acknowledge that this
symptom of the disorder has reached your own threshold; but when it is
known that a few of your bibliographical books are left with the edges
uncut <i>merely to please your friends</i> (as one must sometimes study
their tastes as well as one's own), I trust that no very serious
conclusions will be drawn about the fatality of your own case.</p>

<p>I have very little to add in illustration of Lysander's
well-pointed sarcasms relating to this <i>second symptom of</i>
<span class="smcap">Book-Madness</span>. I think I once heard of an uncut <i>Cranmer's
Bible</i>; but have actually seen a similar conditioned copy of
<i>Purchas's Pilgrimes and Pilgrimage</i>, which is now in the
beautiful library of the Honourable T. Grenville.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">As to uncut copies, although their inconvenience [an uncut Lexicon to
wit!] and deformity must be acknowledged, and although a rational man
can wish for nothing better than a book <i>once well bound</i>, yet we find
that the extraordinary passion for collecting them not only obtains
with full force, but is attended with very serious consequences to
those "que n'out point des pistoles" (to borrow the idea of Clement;
vol. vi. p. 36). I dare say an uncut <i>first Shakspeare</i>, as well as an
<i>uncut vellum Aldus</i><a name="FNanchor_432_438" id="FNanchor_432_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_438" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> would produce a little annuity!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_432_438" id="Footnote_432_438"></a><a href="#FNanchor_432_438">[432]</a> I doubt of the existence of an uncut <i>first
Shakspeare</i>; although we have recently had evidence of an
uncut <i>first Homer</i>; for thus speaks Peignot: "A superb copy
of this Editio Princeps was sold at the sale of M. de
Cotte's books, in 1804, for 3601 livres: but it must be
remarked that this copy was in the most exquisite
preservation, as if it had just come from the press.
Moreover, it is probably the only one the margins of which
have never been either 'shaven or shorn.'" <i>Curiosités
Bibliographiques</i>, p. lxv. vi.; see also <a href="#Page_79">p. 79</a>, ante. Dr.
Harwood, at page 338, of his <i>View of the Editions of the
Classics</i>, speaks of an uncut vellum Aldus, of 1504, 8vo.
"Mr. Quin shewed me a fine copy of it printed in vellum with
the <i>leaves uncut</i>, which he bought of Mr. Egerton at a very
moderate price. It is, perhaps (adds he), the only <i>uncut</i>
vellum Aldus in the world." From the joyous strain of this
extract, the Doctor may be fairly suspected of having
strongly exhibited this second symptom of the Bibliomania!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span><span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 'Tis very strange'&mdash;as Hamlet says at the walking of his

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand</span>. You have touched a vibrating string indeed!&mdash;but I will
suppress my own feelings, and spare those of my friend. A passion for
books <i>illustrated</i>, or adorned with <i>numerous Prints</i><a name="FNanchor_433_439" id="FNanchor_433_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_439" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
representing characters, or circumstances, mentioned in the work, is a
very general and violent symptom of the Bibliomania. The origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span> or
first appearance, of this symptom, has been traced by some to the
publication of the Rev. &mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">Granger's</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span> "<i>Biographical History of
England</i>;" but whoever will be at the pains of reading the preface of
that work will see that Granger shelters himself under the authorities
of <span class="smcap">Evelyn</span>, <span class="smcap">Ashmole</span>, and others; and that he <i>alone</i> is not to be
considered as responsible for all the mischief which this passion for
collecting prints has occasioned. Granger, however, was the first who
introduced it in the form of a history; and surely "in an evil hour"
was that history published; although its amiable author must be
acquitted of "malice prepense."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_433_439" id="Footnote_433_439"></a><a href="#FNanchor_433_439">[433]</a> This third symptom has not escaped the

<p>These are happy thoughts, happily expressed. In illustration
of v. 123, the author observes,&mdash;"three fine heads, for the
sake of which, the beautiful and interesting commentaries of
Sir Francis Vere have been mutilated by collectors of
English portraits." Dr. Ferriar might have added that, when
a Grangerian bibliomaniac commences his <span class="smcap">illustrating career</span>,
he does not fail to make a desperate onset upon <i>Speed</i>,
<i>Boissard</i>, and the <i>Heroologia</i>. Even the lovely prints of
<i>Houbraken</i> (in Dr. Birch's account of Illustrious Persons
of Great Britain) escape not the ravages of his passion for
illustration. The plates which adorn these books are
considered among the foundation materials of a Grangerian
building. But it is time, according to my plan, to introduce
other sarcastic strains of poetry.</p>

<p>At this stage of our inquiries, let me submit a new remedy
as an acquisition to the <i>Materia Medica</i>, of which many
first-rate physicians may not be aware&mdash;by proposing a
</p>

<p class="center"><span class="bl">Recipe for Illustration.</span></p>

<p>Take any passage from any author&mdash;to wit: the following
(which I have done, quite at random) from <span class="smcap">Speed</span>: '<i>Henry le
Spenser</i>, the warlike <i>Bishop of Norwich</i>, being drawn on by
<i>Pope Vrban</i> to preach <i>the Crusade</i>, and to be General
against <i>Clement</i> (whom sundry <i>Cardinals</i> and great
<i>Prelates</i> had also elected Pope) having a fifteenth granted
to him, for that purpose, by <i>parliament</i>,' &amp;c. <i>Historie of
Great Britaine</i>, p. 721, edit. 1632. Now, let the reader
observe, here are <i>only four</i> lines; but which, to be
<span class="smcap">properly illustrated</span>, should be treated thus: 1st, procure
all the portraits, at all periods of his life, of <i>Henry le
Spencer</i>; 2dly, obtain every view, ancient and modern, like
or unlike, of the city of <i>Norwich</i>; and, if fortune favour
you, of <i>every Bishop of the same see</i>; 3dly, every portrait
of <i>Pope Vrban</i> must be procured; and as many prints and
drawings as can give some notion of <i>the Crusade</i>&mdash;together
with a few etchings (if there be any) of <i>Peter the Hermit</i>
and <i>Richard I.</i>, who took such active parts in the Crusade;
4thly, you must search high and low, early and late, for
every print of <i>Clement</i>; 5thly, procure, or you will be
wretched, as many fine prints of <i>Cardinals</i> and <i>Prelates</i>,
singly or in groups, as will impress you with a proper idea
of <i>the Conclave</i>; and 6thly, see whether you may not
obtain, at some of our most distinguished old-print sellers,
views of the <i>house of Parliament</i> at the period (A.D.
1383.) here described!!! The result, gentle reader, will be
this: you will have work enough cut out to occupy you for
one whole month at least, from rise to set of sun&mdash;in
parading the streets of our metropolis: nor will the expense
in <i>coach</i> hire, or <i>shoe leather</i>, be the least which you
will have to encounter! The prints themselves may cost
<i>some</i>thing! Lest any fastidious and cynical critic should
accuse me, and with apparent justice, of gross exaggeration
or ignorance in this <i>recipe</i>, I will inform him, on good
authority, that a late distinguished and highly respectable
female collector, who had commenced an <span class="smcap">illustrated bible</span>,
procured not fewer than <i>seven hundred prints</i> for the
illustration of the 20th, 21st, 22d, 23d, 24th, and 25th
verses of the 1st chapter of Genesis! The illustrated copy
of Mr. Fox's Historical work, mentioned in the first edition
of this work, p. 63, is now in the possession of Lord
Mountjoy. The similar copy of Walter Scott's edition of
Dryden's works, which has upwards of 650 portraits, is yet
in the possession of Mr. Miller, the bookseller.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">Granger's work seems to have sounded the tocsin for a general rummage
after, and plunder of, old prints. Venerable philosophers, and veteran
heroes, who had long reposed in unmolested dignity within the
magnificent folio volumes which recorded their achievements, were
instantly dragged forth from their peaceful abodes, to be inlaid by
the side of some clumsy modern engraving, within an <i>Illustrated
Granger</i>!</p>

<p class="bp">Nor did the madness stop here. Illustration was the order of the day;
and <i>Shakspeare</i><a name="FNanchor_434_440" id="FNanchor_434_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_440" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> and <i>Clarendon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span> became the next objects of its
attack. From these it has glanced off, in a variety of directions, to
adorn the pages of humbler wights; and the passion, or rather this
symptom of the Bibliomania, yet rages with undiminished force. If
judiciously treated, it is, of all the symptoms, the least liable to
mischief. To possess a series of well-executed portraits of
illustrious men, at different periods of their lives, from blooming
boyhood to phlegmatic old age, is sufficiently amusing; but to possess
<i>every</i> portrait, <i>bad</i>, <i>indifferent</i>, and <i>unlike</i>, betrays such a
dangerous and alarming symptom as to render the case almost incurable!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_434_440" id="Footnote_434_440"></a><a href="#FNanchor_434_440">[434]</a> Lysander would not have run on in this
declamatory strain, if it had been <i>his</i> good fortune, as it
has been <i>mine</i>, to witness the extraordinary copy of an
<span class="smcap">illustrated Shakspeare</span> in the possession of Earl Spencer;
which owes its magic to the perseverance and taste of the
Dowager Lady Lucan, mother to the present Countess Spencer.
For sixteen years did this accomplished Lady pursue the
pleasurable toil of illustration; having commenced it in her
50th, and finished it in her 66th year. Whatever of taste,
beauty, and judgment in decoration&mdash;by means of portraits,
landscapes, houses, and tombs&mdash;flowers, birds, insects,
heraldic ornaments, and devices,&mdash;could dress our immortal
bard in a yet more fascinating form, has been accomplished
by the noble hand which undertook so Herculean a task&mdash;and
with a truth, delicacy, and finish of execution, which have
been rarely equalled! These magnificent volumes (being the
folio edition printed by Bulmer) are at once beautiful and
secured by green velvet binding, with embossed clasps and
corners of solid silver, washed with gold. Each volume is
preserved in a silken cover&mdash;and the whole is kept inviolate
from the impurities of bibliomaniacal miasmata, in a
sarcophagus-shaped piece of furniture of cedar and mahogany.
What is the pleasure experienced by the most resolute
antiquary, when he has obtained a peep at the inmost
sarcophagus of the largest pyramid of Egypt, compared with
that which a tasteful bibliomaniac enjoys upon contemplating
this illustrated Shakespeare, now reposing in all the
classical magnificence and congenial retirement of its
possessor?&mdash;But why do I surpass Lysander in the warmth and
vehemence of narration! And yet, let me not forget that the
same noble owner has <i>another</i> illustrated copy of the <span class="smcap">same
bard</span>, on a smaller scale, of which mention has already been
made in my account of the donor of it, the late George
Steevens. Turn, gentle reader, for one moment, to <a href="#Page_428">page 428</a>,
ante. The illustrated <span class="smcap">Clarendon</span>, above hinted at by
Lysander, is in the possession of Mr. H.A. Sutherland; and
is, perhaps, a matchless copy of the author: every siege,
battle, town, and house-view&mdash;as well as portrait&mdash;being
introduced within the leaves. I will not even hazard a
conjecture for how many <i>thousand pounds</i> its owner might
dispose of it, if the inclination of parting with it should
ever possess him. The British Museum has recently been
enriched with a similar copy of <span class="smcap">Pennant's</span> <i>London</i>, on large
paper. Prints and drawings of all descriptions, which could
throw light upon the antiquities of our metropolis, are
inserted in this extraordinary copy, which belonged to the
late Mr. Crowles; who expended 2000<i>l.</i> upon the same, and
who bequeathed it, in the true spirit of <i>virtû</i>, to the
Museum. Let <span class="smcap">Cracherode</span> and <span class="smcap">Crowles</span> be held in respectful
remembrance!</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp">There is another mode of <i>illustrating copies</i> by which this symptom
of the Bibliomania may be known; it consists in bringing together,
from different works, [including newspapers and magazines, and by
means of the scissars, or otherwise by transcription] every page or
paragraph which has any connexion with the character or subject under
discussion. This is a useful<a name="FNanchor_435_441" id="FNanchor_435_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_441" class="fnanchor">[435]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span> and entertaining mode of
illustrating a favourite author; and copies of works of this nature,
when executed by skilful hands, should be deposited in public
libraries; as many a biographical anecdote of eminent literary
characters is preserved in consequence. I almost ridiculed the idea of
an <i>Illustrated Chatterton</i>, 'till the sight of your friend <span class="smcap">Bernardo's</span>
copy, in eighteen volumes, made me a convert to the utility that may
be derived from a judicious treatment of this symptom of the
Bibliomania: and indeed, of a rainy day, the same bibliomaniac's
similar copy of <i>Walton's Complete Angler</i> affords abundant amusement
in the perusal.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_435_441" id="Footnote_435_441"></a><a href="#FNanchor_435_441">[435]</a> Numerous are the instances of the peculiar
use and value of copies of this kind; especially to those
who are engaged in publications of a similar nature. <span class="smcap">Oldys's</span>
<i>interleaved Langbaine</i> (of Mr. Reed's transcript of which a
copy is in the possession of Mr. Heber) is re-echoed in
almost every recent work connected with the belles-lettres
of our country. Oldys himself was unrivalled in this method
of illustration; if, exclusively of Langbaine, his copy of
<i>Fuller's Worthies</i> [once Mr. Steevens', now Mr. Malone's.
See <i>Bibl. Steevens</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 1799] be alone considered! This
Oldys was the oddest mortal that ever wrote. Grose, in his
<i>Olio</i>, gives an amusing account of his having "a number of
small parchment bags inscribed with the names of the persons
whose lives he intended to write; into which he put every
circumstance and anecdote he could collect, and from thence
drew up his history." See Noble's <i>College of Arms</i>, p. 420.
Thus far the first edition of this work; p. 64. It remains
to add that, whatever were the singularities and
capriciousness of Oldys, his talents were far beyond
mediocrity; as his publication of the <i>Harleian Miscellany</i>,
and <i>Raleigh's History of the World</i>, abundantly prove. To
the latter, a life of Raleigh is prefixed; and the number of
pithy, pleasant, and profitable notes subjoined shew that
Oldys's bibliographical talents were not eclipsed by those
of any contemporary. His <i>British Librarian</i> has been more
than once noticed in the preceding pages: vide p. <a href="#Page_51">51</a>, <a href="#Page_468">468</a>.
There is a portrait of him, in a full-dressed suit and
bag-wig, in one of the numbers of the European Magazine;
which has the complete air of a fine gentleman. Let me just
observe, in elucidation of what Lysander above means by this
latter mode of illustrating copies, that in the Bodleian
library there is a copy of <i>Kuster's edition of Suidas</i>
filled, from beginning to end, with MS. notes and excerpts
of various kinds, by the famous D'Orville, tending to
illustrate the ancient lexicographer.</p>

warning-voice uttered by <span class="smcap">Rowe Mores</span>, in his criticism upon
the Catalogue of English Heads, published by Ames: 'This
performance (says the splenetic and too prophetic critic) is
not to be despised: judiciously executed, a work of this
sort would be an appendage entertaining and useful to the
readers of English biography; and it ought to be done at the
common labour, expense, and charges of these
<i>Iconoclasts</i>&mdash;because their depredations are a grand
impediment to another who should attempt it: and if this
<i>goût</i> for prints and thieving continues, let private owners
and public libraries look well to their books, for there
will not remain a valuable book ungarbled by their
connoisseuring villany: for neither honesty nor oaths
restrain them. Yet these <i>fanciers</i>, if prints themselves
are to be collected, instead of being injurious to every
body, might make themselves serviceable to posterity, and
become a kind of <i>medalists</i> (who, by the bye, are almost as
great thieves as themselves, though the hurt they do is not
so extensive, as it lies chiefly among themselves, who all
hold this doctrine, that "exchange is no robbery;" but, if
they could filch without exchanging, no scruple of
conscience would prevent them): we say they might render
themselves useful to posterity, by gathering together the
historical, political, satyrical, anecdotal and temporal
pieces, with which the age abounds; adding an explanation of
the intent and meaning for the instruction and amusement of
times to come. The misfortune is, they must buy the one, but
they can steal the other; and steal they will, although
watched with the eyes of Argus: unless the valuables, like
some other <i>jocalia</i>, are shewn to them through a grate; and
even <i>then</i>, the keeper must be vigilant!' <i>Of English
Founders and Foundries</i>; p. 85. This extract is curious on
account of the tart, but just, sentiments which prevail in
it; but, to the bibliomaniac, it is doubly curious, when he
is informed that <i>only eighty copies</i> of this Typographical
Treatise (of 100 pages&mdash;including the Appendix) were
printed. The author was a testy, but sagacious,
bibliomaniac, and should have been introduced among his

collection exhibited, like its owner, a strange mixture of
what was curious, whimsical, and ingenious in human nature.
There were 2838 lots of printed books. <i>The rare old
black-letter books and tracts</i>, begin at p. 52.</p>

finished, or in the outline, or ghostly white! Then you must go to

successfully gleaned, it remains for me&mdash;who have been
described as sitting in a corner to compile notes for
Lysander's text-discourse&mdash;to add something by way of

Messrs. King and Lochée, April, 1810.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">But it is time to pause. The present note may have
completely served to shew, not only that Lysander was right
in drawing such bold conclusions respecting the consequences
resulting from the publication of Granger's Biographical
History, and the capriciousness of print-fanciers respecting
impressions <i>in their various stages</i>, and with <i>all their
varieties</i>,&mdash;but, that the pursuit of <span class="smcap">print-collecting</span> is
both costly and endless. For one 'fine and rare' <i>print</i>, by
Hollar, Faithorne, Elstracke, the Passes, Delaram, or White,
how many truly precious and useful <i>volumes</i> may be
collected? "All this is vastly fine reasoning"&mdash;methinks I
hear a Grangerite exclaim&mdash;"but compare the comfort afforded
by your 'precious and useful volumes' with that arising from
the contemplation of eminent and extraordinary characters,
executed by the <i>burin</i> of some of those graphic heroes
before-mentioned&mdash;and how despicable will the dry unadorned
volume appear!! On a dull, or rainy day, look at an
illustrated Shakespeare, or Hume, and then find it in your
heart, if you can, to depreciate the <span class="smcap">Grangerian Passion</span>!!" I
answer, the Grangerite is madder than the Bibliomaniac:&mdash;and
so let the matter rest.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>Next let us discuss the serious subject of the <i>background</i>!&mdash;whether
it be square or oval; dark or light; put in or put out; stippled or
stroked; and sundry other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span> similar, but most important,
considerations. Again; there are engravings of <i>different sizes</i>, and
<i>at different periods</i>, of the same individual, or object: and of
these, the varieties are as infinite as of any of those attached to
the vegetable system. I will not attempt even an outline of them. But
I had nearly forgotten to warn you, in your <span class="smcap">Rembrandt</span> <i>Prints</i>, to
look sharply after <i>the Burr</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> Mercy on us&mdash;what is this <i>Burr</i>?!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> A slight imperfection only; which, as it rarely occurs, makes
the impression more valuable. It is only a sombre tinge attached to
the copper, before the plate is sufficiently polished by being worked;
and it gives a smeared effect, like smut upon a lady's face, to the
impression! But I am becoming satirical. Which is the next symptom
that you have written down for me to discourse upon?</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> I am quite attentive to this delineation of a <i>Print

Rembrandt's prints (according to a MS. note prefixed to my

<i>only fifty</i> impressions were struck off) was sold at
Liverpool, in 1799, in one lot; and purchased by Messrs.
Colnaghi, Manson, and Vernon, for 610<i>l.</i> It was sold in
1800, in separate lots, for 650<i>l.</i>, exclusively of every
expense; after the purchasers had been offered 800<i>l.</i> for
the same. Some of these prints came into the possession of
the late Mr. Woodhouse (vide <a href="#Page_441">p. 441</a>, ante); and it is from

<p>Perhaps the finest collection of <span class="smcap">Rembrandt's prints</span>, in
great Britain, is that in the possession of Lord Viscount

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Is that so formidable?</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> The longest life were hardly able to make the collection of
Hogarth's prints complete! The late Mr. Ireland has been the Linnæus
to whom we are indebted for the most minute and amusing classification
of the almost innumerable varieties of the impressions of Hogarth's
plates.<a name="FNanchor_439_445" id="FNanchor_439_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_445" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_439_445" id="Footnote_439_445"></a><a href="#FNanchor_439_445">[439]</a> The Marquis of Bute has, I believe, the most
extraordinary and complete collection of <span class="smcap">Hogarth's Prints</span>
that is known. Of the <i>Election Dinner</i> there are six or
seven varieties; gloves, and no gloves; hats, from one to
the usual number; lemon, and no lemon; punch bowl, and no
punch bowl. But of these <i>varying</i> prints, the most curious
is the one known by the name of <i>Evening</i>: with a little boy
and girl, crying, in the back-ground. At first, Hogarth did
<i>not</i> paint <i>the girl</i>, and struck off very few impressions
of the plate in this state of the picture. A friend
observing to him that the boy was crying with no apparent
cause of provocation, Hogarth put in the little girl
tantalizing him. But&mdash;happy he! who has the print of the
'Evening' <i>without</i> the little girl: fifteen golden guineas
(rare things now to meet with!) ought not to induce him to
part with it. Of the copper-plate portraits by Hogarth, the
original of '<i>Sarah Malcolm, executed</i> 1732,' is among the
very rarest; a copy of this selling for 7<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
at Barnard's sale. The reader has only to procure that most
interesting of all illustrative works, <i>Hogarth Illustrated
by John Ireland</i>, 1793, (2d edit.) 3 vols., 8vo.; and, for a
comparatively trifling sum, he may be initiated into all the
mysteries of Hogarthian <i>virtû</i>. The late Right Hon. W.
Wyndham's collection of Hogarth's prints, bequeathed to him
by Mr. George Steevens, was <i>bought in</i> for little more than
300 guineas.</p>

<p>One of the most curious proofs of the seductive popularity
of unique copies may be drawn from the following excerpt
from a catalogue of a Library sold at Utrecht in 1776; which
was furnished me by Mr. H. Ellis from a copy of the
catalogue in the possession of Mr. Cayley of the
Augmentation Office.
</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="sm">NO.</span> 6870. Les Avantures de Telemaque, 8<span class="super">o</span>. Rotterd. <i>av.
fig. en cart.</i> 'Cet exemplaire est tout <i>barbouillé</i>. Mais
il est <i>de la main de la jeune Princesse Wilhelmine Auguste
de Saxe-Weimar, qui y a appris le François en</i> 1701!!!'</p>

<p>I will mention a unique copy of a somewhat different cast of
character. Of the magnificent and matchless edition of
Shakspeare, printed by Mr. Bulmer and published by Mr.
Nicols, between the years 1790 and 1805, there were one
hundred copies, of the first six plays only, struck off upon
imperial folio, or <i>Colombier paper</i>; in which the large
engravings, published at the Shakspeare Gallery (now the
British Institution) might be incorporated and bound up. The
late George Steevens undertook the revision of the text,
intending to complete the entire plays in a similar form;
but the trouble and expense attending this part of the
undertaking were so great that the further prosecution of it
was abandoned. Mr. Bulmer preserved the whole of the
proof-sheets of this partial Colombier impression; and to
form a '<i>unique</i> edition' (these are his own words) he bound
them up in the exact order in which the plays were printed.
On the margins of many of the sheets, besides the various
corrections, emendations, and notes to the printer, by Mr.
Steevens, there are some original sonnets, a scene for a
burlesque tragedy, and other happy effusions from the pen of
the same elegant and learned editor. Need I ask the reader,
whether he would have the <i>barbouillé</i> (unique) copy of
Telemaque of the young Princesse Wilhelmine Auguste de
Saxe-Weimar (like the Vicar of Wakefield, I like to give the
full name) or Mr. Bulmer's similar copy of Shakspeare? The
difference would soon be found in King Street or the Strand!
I must mention one more example&mdash;of a nature different from
both the preceding&mdash;of what Lysander has above, elaborately,
and perhaps, a little confusedly, described as unique
copies. It is Colonel Stanley's copy of <i>De Bry</i> (see a
superb one before noticed) which is bound in seven folio
volumes, in blue morocco, by Padaloup, and is considered
superior to every known copy. It contains all the maps and
prints, with their variations, according to the
<i>Bibliographie Instructive</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 4230, <i>Cat. de Paris de
Meyzieu</i>, 1790; n<span class="super">o</span>. 486, <i>Cat. de Santander</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>.
3690; and <i>Camus sur les Collections des Grands et Petits
Voyages</i>, 1802, 4to.: with both editions of the first nine
parts of the West Indies, and duplicates of parts x. and xi.
It has also a considerable number of duplicate plates, where
a superior impression could be procured at any expense. The
owner of this unique copy, of a work unrivalled for its
utility and elegance, is distinguished for a noble
collection, bound by our choicest binders, in whatever is
splendid and precious in the Belles Lettres, Voyages, and
Travels. Take two more illustrations, kind-hearted
reader!&mdash;&mdash;<i>Goldsmith's Deserted Village</i>, 1802. Mr. Bulmer
printed a single copy of this beautiful poem, in quarto,
<span class="smcap">upon satin</span>&mdash;picked and prepared in a very curious manner. It
was purchased by a foreigner. His impressions <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>
are noticed, <a href="#Footnote_445_451">post</a>.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Falconer's Shipwreck</i>, 1804, 8vo. Mr.

father-in-law of Lamoignon, is made at <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>, ante. The
reader is here presented with a more finished portrait of
this extraordinary bibliomaniac: a portrait, which will
excite his unbounded admiration, if not envy!&mdash;for such a
careful and voluptuous collector, in regard to <i>binding</i>,
was, I believe, never before known; nor has he been since
eclipsed. 'M. Berryer, successivement Secrétaire d'Etat au
Département de la Marìne, Ministre, puis Garde des Sceaux de
France, s'étoit occupé pendant près de quarante années à se
former un cabinet des plus beaux livres grecs et latins,
anciennes éditions, soit de France, soit des pays étrangers,
&amp;c. Par un soin et une patience infatigables, à l'aide de
plusieurs coopérateurs éclairés, savans même en
Bibliographie, qui connoissoient ses études, délassement de
ses places, il avoit recueilli les plus belles éditions; de
telle sorte qu'il a toujours su se procurer un exemplaire
parfait de chaque édition par un moyen simple quoique
dispendieux. Si les Catalogues des ventes publiques lui
apprenoient qu'il existoit un exemplaire <i>plus beau, plus
grand de marge, mieux conservé</i>, de tout auteur, &amp;c., que
celui qu'il possédoit, il le fasoit acquérir sans
s'embarrasser du prix, et il se défaisoit à perte de
l'exemplaire moins beau. La majeure partie des auteurs
anciens et modernes de son cabinet a été changée huit ou dix
fois de cette manière. Il ne <i>s'arrêtoit</i> qu'après s'être
assuré qu'il avoit <i>le plus bel exemplaire connu</i>, soit pour
la marge, soit pour la force du papier, soit pour la
magnificence de la conservation et <i>de la relieure</i>.' 'A
l'égard des ouvrages d'editions modernes, même celles faites
en pays étranger, M. Berryer vouloit les avoir en feuilles:
il en faisoit choisir, dans plusieurs exemplaires, un
parfait, et il le faisoit relier <i>en maroquin de choix</i>; le
Ministere de la Marìne qu'il avoit rempli, lui ayant donné
toutes les facilités d'en être abondamment et fidèlement
pourvu dans toutes les Echelles du Levant. On collationnoit
ensuite pour vérifier s' il n'y avoit ni transposition, ni
omission de feuilles ou de pages?!!' <i>Cat. M. Lamoignon</i>,
1791. pref. p. ij. iij. Berryer was slightly copied by
Caillard (of whom see <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a>, ante) in the luxury of
<i>book-binding</i>. 'M. Caillard avoit le soin <i>de faire
satiner</i> presque tous livres qu'il faisoit relier, et
principalement les grands ouvrages; qu'il est difficile
d'avoir parfaitement reliés sans ce precedé.' <i>Cat. de
Caillard</i>; p. x. (avertisement.) But I know not whether
Caillard did not catch the phrensy from the elder Mirabeau.
In the catalogue of his books, p. <span class="smcap">ii.</span>, we are thus told of
him:&mdash;'l'acquisition d'un <i>beau livre</i> lui causoit des
transports de joie inexprimables: il l'examinoit, <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: l'admiroit">l'admiriot</span>:
il vouloit que chacun
partagêat avec lui le même enthousiasme.' His biographer
properly adds: 'De quelle surprise n'auroit-on pas été, si
l'on eût su que c'etoit la le même homme qui, du haut de la
tribune, faisoit trembler les despotes et les factieux!'
Ponder here, gentle reader, upon the effects of a
<i>beautiful</i> book! Let no one, however, imagine that we
<i>grave Englishmen</i> are averse or indifferent to 'le luxe de
la relieure'!! No: at this present moment, we have the best
bookbinders in Europe; nor do we want good authority for the
encouragement of this fascinating department relating to the
Bibliomania. Read here what Mr. Roscoe hath so eloquently
written in commendation of it: 'A taste for the exterior
decoration of books has lately arisen in this country, in
the gratification of which no small share of ingenuity has
been displayed; but if we are to judge of the present
predilection for learning by the degree of expense thus
incurred, we must consider it as greatly inferior to that of
the Romans during the times of the first Emperors, or of the
Italians at the 15th century. And yet it is, perhaps,
difficult to discover why a <span class="smcap">favourite book</span> should not be as
proper an object of elegant ornament as the head of a cane,
the hilt of a sword, or the latchet of a shoe.' <i>Lorenzo de
Medici</i>; vol. ii., 79, 8vo. edition. Did Geyler allude to
such bibliomaniacs in the following sentence? Sunt qui
libros inaurant et serica tegimenta apponunt preciosa et
superba. Grandis hæc fatuitas! <i>Navicula, sive Speculum
Fatuorum</i>; (Navis Stultifera) <i>sign. B. v. rev.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> It only means, Belinda, that this said shepherd was blockhead
enough to keep gazing upon his beloved fair, although every glance
shot him through the heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span> and killed him a hundred times. Still he
caressed the cause of his ruin. And so bibliomaniacs hug the very

money! I have not forgotten your account of Dr. Dee:<a name="FNanchor_444_450" id="FNanchor_444_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_450" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> but the

rarely to be obtained of modern date, the collector is obliged to have
recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span> to specimens executed, three centuries ago, in the printing
offices of Aldus, Verard, or the Giunti. Although the <i>Bibliotheque
Imperiale</i>, at Paris, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span> library of Count M'Carthy, at Toulouse,
are said to contain the greatest number of books, printed upon vellum,
yet, those who have been fortunate enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span> see copies of this kind
in the libraries of his Majesty, the Duke of Marlborough, Earl
Spencer, Mr. Johnes, and the late Mr. Cracherode (which latter is now
in the British Museum) need not travel on the Continent for the sake
of being convinced of their exquisite beauty and splendour. An
<i>unique</i> copy of the first Livy, upon vellum, (of which the owner has
excited the envy of foreigners) is a library of itself!&mdash;and the
existence of vellum copies of Wynkyn De Worde's reprint of <i>Juliana
Barnes's Book of Hawking, &amp;c.</i>, complete in every respect, (to say
nothing of his Majesty's similar copy of Caxton's <i>Doctrinal of
Sapience</i>, in the finest preservation)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span> are sufficient demonstrations
of the prevalance of this symptoms of the Bibliomania in the times of
our forefathers; so that it cannot be said, as some have asserted, to
have appeared entirely within the last half century.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_445_451" id="Footnote_445_451"></a><a href="#FNanchor_445_451">[445]</a> William Horman, who was head master of Eton
school at the opening of the sixteenth century, was, I
apprehend, the earliest writer in this country who
propagated those symptoms of the Bibliomania indicative of a
passion for <i>large paper</i> and <i>vellum</i> copies; for thus
writes the said Horman, in his <i>Vulgaria</i>, printed by
Pynson, in folio, 1519: a book, curious and interesting upon
every account. 'The greatest and highest of price, is <i>paper
imperial</i>. (Herbert, vol i., p. 265.) <i>Parchment leaves</i> be
wont to be ruled, that there may be a <i>comely margent</i>:
also, strait lines of equal distance be draw[en] within,
that the writing may shew fair,' <i>fol.</i> 82. From these two
sentences (without quoting Horman's praise of the presses of
Froben and Aldus; fol. 87) I think it may be fairly inferred
that a love of <i>large paper</i> and <i>vellum</i> copies was
beginning to display itself in the period just mentioned.
That this love or passion is now eagerly and generally
evinced, I shall proceed to give abundant proof; but first
let me not forget our bibliomaniacal satirist:</p>

<p>Lysander has above noticed the collection of Count M'Carthy
of Toulouse. By the kindness of Mr. Roche, banker, at Cork,
I learn that this collection 'is a truly splendid one.' The
possessor's talents are not confined to the partial walk of
bibliography: in his younger years, he was considered one of
the first gentlemen-violin players in Europe. He quitted
Ireland forty years ago, and now resides at Toulouse, in his
70th year, surrounded by a numerous and respectable family.
His leading passion, in book-collecting, (like his
countryman's, poor Mr. Quin&mdash;who gave 170 guineas for the
Spira Virgil of 1470, <i>in membranis</i>!) is marked by a
fondness for works <i>printed upon vellum</i>. From Mr. Roche,
Mr. Edwards, and other quarters, I am enabled to present the

<p>I have heard that Count M'Carthy's books do not exceed 4000
in number; and of these, perhaps, no private collector in
Europe has an equal number printed upon vellum. In our own
country, however, the finest <span class="smcap">vellum library</span> in the world
might be composed from the collections of His Majesty, the
Duke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Sir M.M. Sykes, Bart.,
Mr. Johnes, Mr. Coke, and the Quin collection. Yet let us
not forget the finest <i>vellum copy</i> in the world of the
first edition of <i>Aristotle's works</i> (wanting one volume)
which may be seen in the library of Corpus Christi College,
Oxford. Of Mr. Edward's <i>similar</i> copy <i>of the first Livy</i>,
Lysander and myself (vide <a href="#PART_III">Part <span class="smcap">iii.</span></a>) have spoken like honest
bibliomaniacs. Earl Spencer possesses the rival volume,
printed by the same printers, (Sweynheym and Pannartz) and
upon the same material, in his Pliny Senior of 1470&mdash;But let
all quiet bibliomaniacs wait with patience till the work of
Mons. Praet upon this subject, alluded to at <a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>, ante,
shall have made its appearance! and then&mdash;let us see whether
we can prevail upon some Gnome to transport to us, through
the 'thin air,' Pynson's '<i>Ship of Fools</i>' <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>!!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Are we as successful in printing upon vellum as were our
forefathers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Certainly not; if we except some of the works from the press
of Bodoni&mdash;which are oftentimes truly brilliant. But the fault, in
general, is rather in the preparation of the vellum than in the
execution of the press-work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> You have seen, Lisardo, my small volumes of '<i>Heures</i>,' or
'<i>Missals</i>,' as they are called; some of them in MS. and others in
print&mdash;and what can be more delicate than the texture of the vellum
leaves, or more perfect than the execution of penmanship and printing?</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> I have often set whole hours, my dear brother, in contemplating
with rapture the sparkling radiance of these little volumes; and wish
in my heart I had a few favourite authors executed in a similar
manner! I should like to employ Bodoni<a name="FNanchor_446_452" id="FNanchor_446_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_452" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> for life.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_446_452" id="Footnote_446_452"></a><a href="#FNanchor_446_452">[446]</a> It is not because Bodoni printed better than
our popular printers&mdash;that his books upon vellum are more
beautiful than those produced by the London presses&mdash;but
that the Italian vellum (made of the abortive calf) is, in
general, more white and delicate. There is not, perhaps, a
lovelier little <span class="smcap">vellum book</span> in existence than the <i>Castle of
Otranto</i>, printed by Bodoni in 1796, 8vo. A copy of this,
with the plates worked on white satin, was in the collection
of Mr. G.G. Mills; and sold at the sale of his books in
1800; n<span class="super">o</span>. 181; see <a href="#Page_447">p. 447</a>, ante. From the former
authority it would appear that only six copies were printed
in this manner. By the kindness of Mr. Edwards, I am in
possession of a '<i>Lettera Pastorale</i>' of Fr. Adeodato
Turchi&mdash;a small tract of 38 pages&mdash;printed upon paper, by
Bodoni, in a style of uncommon delicacy: having all the
finish and picturesque effect of copper-plate execution. But
the chef d'&#339;uvre of Bodoni seems to be an edition of
<i>Homer</i>, in three great folio volumes, each consisting of
370 pages, with the text only. The artist employed six years
in the preparations, and the printing occupied eighteen
months. One hundred and forty copies only were struck off.
The copy presented to Bonaparte was <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>, of a size
and brilliancy altogether unparalleled. <i>American Review</i>,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 1., p. 171. January, 1811. In our admiration of
Bodoni, let us not forget <span class="smcap">Didot</span>: who printed a single copy
of <i>Voltaire's Henriade</i> <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>, in quarto, with a
brilliancy of execution, and perfection of vellum, which can
never be <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: surpassed">suppassed</span>. This
copy formerly belonged to a Farmer General, one of Didot's
most intimate friends, who perished in the Revolution. Didot
also printed a number of copies of French translations of
English works, upon the same material: so correct,
beautiful, and tasteful, that Mr. Bulmer assures me nothing
could exceed it. All these small richly-feathered birds were
once here, but have now taken their flight to a warmer
climate. Our modern books upon vellum are little short of
being downright wretched. I saw the <i>Life of Nelson</i>, in two
large quartos, printed in this manner; and it would have
been the first work which I should have recommended a
first-rate collector to have thrown out of his library.<a name="FNanchor_G_453" id="FNanchor_G_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_453" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
Many of the leaves were afflicted with the jaundice beyond
hope of cure. The censure which is here thrown out upon
others reaches my own doors: for I attempted to execute a
single copy of my <i>Typographical Antiquities</i> upon vellum,
with every possible attention to printing and to the
material upon which it was to be executed. But I failed in
every point: and this single wretchedly-looking book, had I
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: persevered">presevered</span> in executing my
design, would have cost me about <i>seventy-five</i> guineas!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_G_453" id="Footnote_G_453"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_453">[G]</a> This book was printed at Bolt Court during the
apprenticeship of the printer of this edit. of Biblio., who
speaking from remembrance, ventures to suggest that the
above remark is rather too strong&mdash;although there was
confessedly a great deal of trouble in procuring good
vellum. He believes only <i>one</i> copy was done; it was the
property of Alexander Davidson, Esq. Banker, and, being in
his library in Ireland, when the mansion was burned down, it
was destroyed. He had insured it for £600&mdash;the Insurance
office disputed his claim, and a trial at Dublin took place.
The late Mr. Bensley was subp&#339;naed to give evidence of
its value, but, being reluctant to go, he persuaded the
parties that Warwick, one of his pressmen, who worked it
off, was a better witness; he accordingly went, his evidence
succeeding in establishing Mr. Davidson's claim. This same
Warwick worked off many of the splendid specimens of
typography mentioned in <i>Bibliomania</i>, being one of the very
best workmen in the Printing business&mdash;particularly in
wood-cuts. He afterwards became private printer to the late
Sir Egerton Bridges, Bart., at Lee Priory&mdash;and is long since
dead.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> From the time of Ancillon to Askew, there has been a very

as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span> they are in general superintended and corrected by the author
himself, and, like the first impressions of prints are considered more
valuable. Whoever is possessed with a passion for collecting books of
this kind, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span> unquestionably be said to exhibit a strong symptom of
the Bibliomania: but such a case is not quite hopeless, nor is it
deserving of severe treatment or censure. All bibliographers have
dwelt on the importance of these editions<a name="FNanchor_449_456" id="FNanchor_449_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_456" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> for the sake of
collation with subsequent ones; and of detecting, as is frequently the

is the <i>first edition Shakspeare</i><a name="FNanchor_450_457" id="FNanchor_450_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_457" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> considered, on the score of
correctness, that a fac-simile reprint of it has been recently
published. In regard to the Greek and Latin Classics, the possession
of these original editions is of the first consequence to editors who
are anxious to republish the legitimate text of an author. Wakefield,
I believe, always regretted that the first edition of Lucretius had
not been earlier inspected by him. When he began <i>his</i> edition, the
Editio Princeps was not (as I have understood) in that storehouse of
almost every thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span> which is exquisite and rare in ancient and modern

the tempting manner in which, by aid of capital or italic
types, these <span class="smcap">Editiones Primariæ</span> or <i>Editiones Principes</i> are

<p>These first editions are generally, with respect to foreign
works, printed in the fifteenth or in the early part of the
sixteenth century: and indeed we have a pretty rich
sprinkling of a similar description of first editions
executed in our own country. It is not, therefore, without
justice that we are described, by foreign bibliographers, as
being much addicted to this class of books: "With what
avidity, and at what great prices, this character of books
is obtained by the Dutch, and <i>especially by the English</i>,
the very illustrious Zach. Conrad ab Uffenbach shews, in the
preface to the second volume of his catalogue." Vogt; p.
xx., edit. 1793. There is a curious and amusing article in
Bayle (English edition, vol i., 672, &amp;c.) about the elder
Ancillon, who frankly confessed that he "was troubled with
the Bibliomania, or disease of buying books." Mr. D'Israeli
says that he "always purchased <i>first editions</i>, and never
waited for second ones," but I find it, in the English
Bayle, note D, "he chose <i>the best</i> editions." The manner in
which Ancillon's library was pillaged by the Ecclesiastics
of Metz (where it was considered as the most valuable
curiosity in the town) is thus told by Bayle: "Ancillon was
obliged to leave Metz: a company of Ecclesiastics, of all
orders, came from every part, to lay hands on this fine and
copious library, which had been collected with the utmost
care during forty years. They took away a great number of
the books together; and gave a little money, as they went
out, to a young girl, of twelve or thirteen years of age,
who looked after them, that they might have it to say they
had <i>paid for them</i>. Thus Ancillon saw that valuable
collection dispersed, in which, as he was wont to say, his
chief pleasure and even his heart was placed!"&mdash;Edit. 1734.
A pleasant circumstance, connected with our present subject,
occurred to the Rev. Dr. Charles Burney. At a small sale of
books which took place at Messrs. King and Lochée's, some
few years ago, the Doctor sent a commission, for some old
grammatical treatises; and calling with Mr. Edwards to see
the success of the commission, the latter, in the true
spirit of bibliomaniacism, pounced upon an anciently-bound
book, in the lot, which turned out to be&mdash;nothing less than
the <i>first edition</i> of <span class="smcap">Manilius</span> by Regiomontanus: one of the
very scarcest books in the class of those of which we are
treating! By the liberality of the purchaser, this <i>primary
bijou</i> now adorns the noble library of the Bishop of Ely.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_449_456" id="Footnote_449_456"></a><a href="#FNanchor_449_456">[449]</a> An instance of this kind may be adduced from
the <i>first edition</i> of Fabian, printed in 1516; of which
Chronicle Messrs. Longman, Hurst, and Co. have just
published a new edition, superintended by Mr. H. Ellis, and
containing various readings from all the editions at the
foot of the text. "The antiquary," says the late Mr. <span class="smcap">Brand</span>,
"is desired to consult the edition of Fabian, printed by
Pynson, in 1516, because there are others, and I remember to
have seen one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a
continuation to the end of Queen Mary, 1559, in which the
language is much modernized." <i>Shakspeare</i>, edit. 1803, vol.
xviii., pp. 85, 86. See also what has been before said (p.
233.) of an <i>after</i> edition of Speed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_450_457" id="Footnote_450_457"></a><a href="#FNanchor_450_457">[450]</a> A singular story is "extant" about the
purchase of the late Duke of Roxburgh's copy of the first
edition of Shakspeare. A friend was bidding for him in the
sale-room: his Grace had retired to one end of the room,
coolly to view the issue of the contest. The biddings rose
quickly to 20 guineas; a great sum in former times: but the
Duke was not to be daunted or defeated. A slip of paper was
handed to him, upon which the propriety of continuing the
contest was suggested. His Grace took out his pencil; and,
with a coolness which would have done credit to Prince
Eugene, he wrote on the same slip of paper, by way of  reply&mdash;</p>

<p>Such a spirit was irresistible, and bore down all
opposition. The Duke was of course declared victor, and he
marched off, triumphantly, with the volume under his arm.
Lord Spencer has a fine copy of this first edition of
Shakspeare, collated by Steevens himself.</p>

neglected! But there are other characters not less noble,
and of equal glory to a great nation like our own; and they
are those who, to the adventitious splendour of hereditary
rank, add all the worth and talent of a private condition,
less exposed to temptation, and suited to the cultivation of
peaceful and literary pursuits. Such a character is <span class="smcap">George

general love of the fine arts, and acquaintance with

<p class="tp">It must not, however, be forgotten that, if first editions are, in
some instances, of great importance, they are in many respects
superfluous, and only incumber the shelves of a collector; inasmuch as
the labours of subsequent editors have corrected the errors of their
predecessors, and superseded, by a great fund of additional matter,
the necessity of consulting them. Thus, not to mention other instances
(which present themselves while noticing the present one), all the
fine things which Colomiés and Reimannus have said about the rarity of
La Croix du Maine's Bibliothéque, published in 1584, are now

<p>Let us proceed to see whether this biting satire be founded
upon truth, or not. Accidental variations from the common
impressions of a work form what are called <span class="smcap">true editions</span>:
and as copies, with such variations (upon the same principle
as that of <i>Prints</i>; vide <a href="#Page_501">p. 501-2</a>, ante) are rare, they are
of course sought after with avidity by knowing
bibliomaniacs. Thus speaks Ameilhon upon the
subject:&mdash;"pendant l'impression d'un ouvrage il est arrivé
un accident qui, à telle page et à telle ligne, a occasioné
un renversement dans les lettres d'un mot, et que ce
désordre n'a été rétabli qu'apres le tirage de six ou sept
exemplaires; ce qui rend ces exemplaires défectueux presque
uniques, et leur donne, â les entendre, une valeur
inappréciable; car voila un des grands secrets de cet art,
qui, au reste, s'acquiert aisément avec de la memoire."
<i>Mem. de l'Institut</i>: vol. ii., p. 485. The author of these
words then goes on to abuse the purchasers and venders of
these strange books; but I will not quote his saucy tirade
in defamation of this noble department of bibliomaniacism. I
subjoin a few examples in illustration of Lysander's
definition:&mdash;<i>Cæsar. Lug. Bat.</i> 1636, 12mo. <i>Printed by
Elzevir.</i> In the Bibliotheca Revickzkiana we are informed
that the <i>true</i> Elzevir edition is known by having the plate
of a buffalo's head at the beginning of the preface and body
of the work: also by having the page numbered 153, which
<i>ought</i> to have been numbered 149. A further account is
given in my Introduction to the Classics, vol. i., p.
228.&mdash;<i>Horace</i>, Londini, 1733, 8vo., 2 vols. Published by
Pine. The <i>true</i> edition is distinguished by having at page
108, vol. ii., the <i>incorrect</i> reading "Post Est."&mdash;for
"Protest."&mdash;<i>Virgil.</i> Lug. Bat., 1636, 12mo. Printed by
Elzevir. The <i>true</i> edition is known, by having at plate 1,
before the Bucolics, the following Latin passage <i>printed in
red ink</i>. "Ego vero frequentes a te literas accepi." Consul
de Bure, n<span class="super">o</span>. 2684.&mdash;<i>Idem.</i> Birmingh. 1763, 4to. Printed
by Baskerville. A particular account of the <i>true</i> edition
will be found in the second volume of my "Introduction to
the Classics," p. 337&mdash;too long to be here
inserted.&mdash;<i>Bocaccio.</i> Il Decamerone, Venet. 1527, 4to.
Consult De Bure n<span class="super">o</span>. 3667; Bandini, vol. ii. 105, 211;
(who, however, is extremely laconic upon this edition, but
copious upon the anterior one of 1516) and Haym, vol. iii.,
p. 8, edit. 1803. Bibl. Paris., n<span class="super">o</span>. 408. Clement. (vol.
iv. 352,) has abundance of reference, as usual, to
strengthen his assertion in calling the edition "<i>fort
rare</i>." The reprint, or spurious edition, has always struck
me as the prettier book of the two. These examples appeared
in the first edition of this work. I add to them what of
course I was not enabled to do before. In the second edition
of <i>The Bibliomania</i>, there are some variations in the
copies of the small paper; and one or two decided ones
between the small and large. In the small, at page 13, line
2, we read</p>

<p class="center">"beat with perpetual <i>forms</i>."</p>

<p>in the large, it is properly</p>

<p class="center">"beat with perpetual <i>storms</i>."</p>

<p>Which of these is indicative of the <i>true</i> edition? Again:
in the small paper, p. 275, line 20, we read properly</p>

<p class="center">"Claudite jam rivos pueri, sat <i>prata</i> biberunt."</p>

<p>in the large paper,</p>

<p class="center">"Claudite jam rivos pueri, sat <i>parta</i> biberunt."</p>

<p>It was in my power to have cancelled the leaf in the large
paper as well as in the small; but I thought it might
thereby have taken from the former the air of a <i>true</i>
edition; and so the blunder (a mere transposition of the
letters <i>ar</i>) will go down to a future generation in the
large paper. There is yet another slight variation between
the small and large. At p. 111, in the account of the
catalogue of Krohn's books, the concluding sentence wholly
varies: but I believe there is not an <i>error</i> in either, to
entitle one to the rank of <i>Truism</i> more than another.<a name="FNanchor_H_461" id="FNanchor_H_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_461" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_H_461" id="Footnote_H_461"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_461">[H]</a> During the youth of the printer of this book, a
curious mistake occurred: a splendid folio work was going on

technically say, <i>a space stood up</i>; the Dr. (not
understanding printers' marks) wrote on a head page "take
out horizontal line at p. so and so"&mdash;the compositor
inserted these words as a <i>displayed line</i> in the head-page
whereon they were written&mdash;the reader passed it in the
revise&mdash;and it was so worked off! Being eventually
detected&mdash;the leaf was of course cancelled.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Of all symptoms of the Bibliomania, this <i>eighth</i> symptom is
at present the most powerful and prevailing. Whether it was imported

consideration. But whatever be its origin, certain is that books
printed in the <span class="bl">black-letter</span>, are now coveted with an eagerness unknown
to our collectors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span> the last century. If the spirits of West,
Ratcliffe, Farmer, and Brand, have as yet held any intercourse with
each other, in that place "from whose bourne no traveller returns,"

latter, of the prices given for some of the books at the sale of his

<p>But let us attend to a more scientific illustration of this
eighth symptom. '<span class="smcap">Black-Letter</span>, which is used in England,
descends from the Gothic characters; and is therefore called
<i>Gothic</i> by some, <i>old English</i> by others; but printers give
it the name of <i>Black-Letter</i>, because its face taking in a
larger compass than Roman or Italic of the same body, the
full and spreading strokes thereof appear more <i>black</i> upon
paper than common.' <i>Smith's Printer's Grammar</i>; edit. 1755,
p. 18. The same definition is given in a recent similar
work; with the addition that 'black-letter is more expensive
than Roman or Italic, its broad face requiring an
extraordinary quantity of ink, which always gives the best
coloured paper a yellow cast, unless worked upon that of a
superior quality. It has a good effect in a title-page, if
disposed with taste.' Stower's <i>Printer's Grammar</i>; 1808, p.
41. To these authorities we may add, from Rowe Mores, that
'Wynkyn de Worde's letter was of <i>The Square English</i> or
<i>Black face</i>, and has been the pattern for his successors in
the art.' <i>Of English Founders and Foundries</i>; 1778, 8vo. p.
4, 5. 'The same black-letter printer,' says Palmer or
Psalmanaazar, 'gave a greater scope to his fancy, and formed
such a variety of sorts and sizes of letter that, for
several years after him, none of his successors attempted to
imitate him therein.' <i>General History of Printing</i>; p. 343.
It is not necessary to collect, in formal array, the
authorities of foreigners upon this important subject;
although it may be as well to notice the strange manner in
which Momoro, in his <i>Traité elémentaire de L'Imprimerie</i>,
p. 185, refers us to an elucidation of the Gothic letter
('appelé du nom de certains peuples qui vinrent s'établir
dans la Gothie, plus de quatre cens ans avant J.C.') in one
of the plates of Fournier's <i>Dictionnaire Typographique</i>:
vol. ii. p. 205&mdash;which, in truth, resembles anything but the
Gothic type, as understood by modern readers.&mdash;Smith and Mr.
Stower have the hardihood to rejoice at the present general
extinction of the black-letter. They were not, probably,
aware of Hearne's eulogy upon it&mdash;'As it is a reproach to us
(says this renowned antiquary) that the Saxon language
should be so forgot as to have but few (comparatively
speaking) that are able to read it; so 'tis a greater
reproach that the <span class="smcap">Black-Letter</span>, which was the character so
much in use in our grandfathers' days, should be now (as it
were) disused and rejected; especially when we know the best
editions of our English Bible and Common-Prayer (to say
nothing of other books) are printed in it.' <i>Robert of
Gloucester's Chronicle</i>: vol. i., p. <span class="smcap">lxxxv</span>. I presume the
editor and publisher of the forth-coming fac-simile
re-impression of Juliana Barnes's Book of Hawking, Hunting,
&amp;c., are of the same opinion with Hearne: and are resolved
upon eclipsing even the black-letter reputation of the
afore-named Wynkyn De Worde.&mdash;A pleasant black-letter
anecdote is told by Chevillier, of his having picked up, on
a bookseller's stall, the first edition of the <i>Speculum
Salutis</i> sive <i>Humanæ Salvationis</i> (one of the rarest
volumes in the class of those printed in the middle of the
fifteenth century) for the small sum of four livres!
<i>L'Origine de l'Imprimerie</i>; p. 281. This extraordinary
event soon spread abroad, and was circulated in every
bibliographical journal. Schelhorn noticed it in his
<i>Am&#339;nitates Literariæ</i>: vol. iv. 295-6: and so did
Maichelius in his <i>Introd. ad Hist. Lit. et Præcip. Bibl.
Paris</i>, p. 122. Nor has it escaped the notice of a more
recent foreign bibliographer. Ameilhon makes mention of
Chevillier's good fortune; adding that the work was 'un de
ces livres rares au premièr degré, qu' un <span class="smcap">bon Bibliomane</span> ne
peut voir sans trépigner de joie, si j'ose m'exprimer
ainsi.' <i>Mem. de l'Institut</i>. vol. ii. 485-6. This very
copy, which was in the Sorbonne, is now in the Imperial,
library at Paris. <i>Ibid.</i> A similar, though less important,
anecdote is here laid before the reader from a communication
sent to me by Mr. Wm. Hamper of Birmingham. '"<i>Tusser's Five
Hundred Points of Good Husbandry, black-letter, sewed</i>," was
valued at <span class="smcap">sixpence</span>, in a catalogue of a small Collection of
Books on the sale at the shop of Mr. William Adams,
Loughborough, in the year 1804: and, after in vain suing the
coy collector at this humble price, remained unsold to the
present year, 1809, when (thanks to your <i>Bibliomania</i>!) it
brought <span class="smcap">a Golden Guinea</span>.'&mdash;I have myself been accused of 'an
admiration to excess' of black-letter lore; and of
recommending it in every shape, and by every means, directly
and indirectly. Yet I have surely not said or done any thing
half so decisive in recommendation of it as did our great
moralist, Dr. Johnson: who thus introduces the subject in
one of his periodical papers.&mdash;'The eldest and most
venerable of this society, was <span class="smcap">Hirsutus</span>: who, after the
first civilities of my reception, found means to introduce
the mention of his favourite studies, by a severe censure of
those who want the due regard for their native country. He
informed me that he had early withdrawn his attention from
foreign trifles, and that since he begun to addict his mind
to serious and manly studies, he had very carefully amassed
all the <i>English books</i> that were printed in the
<span class="bl">Black-Letter</span>. This search he had pursued so diligently that
he was able to show the deficiencies of the best catalogues.
He had long since completed his <i>Caxton</i>, had three sheets
of <i>Treveris</i>, unknown to antiquaries, and wanted to a
perfect [collection of] <i>Pynson</i> but two volumes: of which
one was promised him as a legacy by its present possessor,
and the other he was resolved to buy at whatever price, when
Quisquilius' library should be sold. Hirsutus had no other
reason for the valuing or slighting a book than that it was
printed in the Roman or the Gothick letter, nor any ideas
but such as his favourite volumes had supplied: when he was
serious, he expatiated on the narratives of <span class="smcap">Johan de
Trevisa</span>, and, when he was merry, regaled us with a quotation
from the <i>Shippe of Fools</i>.' <span class="smcap">Rambler</span>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 177.&mdash;Nor was
the Doctor himself quite easy and happy 'till he had sold,
in the character of a <span class="smcap">bookseller</span>, a few volumes&mdash;probably of
black-letter celebrity. Mr. Boswell relates that 'During the
last visit which the Doctor made to Litchfield, the friends,
with whom he was staying missed him one morning at the
breakfast table. On inquiring after him of the servants,
they understood that he had set off from Litchfield at a
very early hour, without mentioning to any of the family
whither he was going. The day passed without the return of
the illustrious guest, and the party began to be very uneasy
on his account, when, just before the supper hour, the door
opened, and the Doctor stalked into the room. A solemn
silence of a few minutes ensued; nobody daring to enquire
the cause of his absence, which was at length relieved by
Johnson addressing the lady of the house as follows: "Madam,
I beg your pardon for the abruptness of my departure this
morning, but I was constrained to it by my <i>conscience</i>.
Fifty years ago, Madam, on this day, I committed a breach of
filial piety, which has ever since lain heavy on my mind,
and has not until this day been expiated. My father, you
recollect, was a bookseller, and had long been in the habit
of attending <i>Walsall Market</i>; and opening a stall for the
sale of his books during that day. Confined to his bed by
indisposition, he requested of me, this time fifty years
ago, to visit the market, and attend the stall in his place.
But, Madam, my pride prevented me from doing my duty, and I
gave my father a refusal. To do away the sin of this
disobedience, I this day went in a post-chaise to Walsall,
and going into the market at the time of high business,
uncovered my head, and stood with it bare an hour before the
stall which my father had formerly used, exposed to the
sneers of the by-standers, and the inclemency of the
weather: a penance, by which I have propitiated Heaven for
this only instance, I believe, of contumacy towards my
father."'&mdash;Is it not probable that Dr. Johnson himself might
have sold for <span class="smcap">sixpence</span>, a <i>Tusser</i>, which now would have
brought a '<span class="smcap">golden guinea</span>?'</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">A perusal of these prices may probably not impress the reader with any
lofty notions of the superiority of the black-letter; but this symptom
of the Bibliomania is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span> nevertheless, not to be considered as
incurable, or wholly unproductive of good. Under a proper spirit of
modification, it has done, and will continue to do, essential service
to the cause of English literature. It guided the taste, and
strengthened the judgment, of Tyrwhitt in his researches after
Chaucerian lore. It stimulated the studies of Farmer and Steevens, and
enabled them to twine many a beauteous flower round the brow of their
beloved Shakspeare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span></p>

<p class="bp">It has since operated, to the same effect, in the labour of Mr.
Douce,<a name="FNanchor_455_463" id="FNanchor_455_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_463" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> the <span class="smcap">Porson</span> of old English and French Literature; and in
the editions of Milton and Spenser, by my amiable and excellent friend
Mr. Todd, the public have had a specimen of what the <i>Black-Letter</i>
may perform, when temperately and skilfully exercised.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_455_463" id="Footnote_455_463"></a><a href="#FNanchor_455_463">[455]</a> In the criticisms which have passed upon Mr.
<span class="smcap">Douce's</span> "<i>Illustrations of Shakspeare and Ancient Manners</i>,"
it has not, I think, been generally noticed that this work
is distinguished for the singular diffidence and urbanity of
criticism, as well as depth of learning, which it evinces;
and for the happy illustrations of the subjects discussed by
means of fac-simile wood-cuts.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">I could bring to your recollection other instances; but your own
memories will better furnish you with them. Let me not, however, omit
remarking that the beautiful pages of the '<i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish
Border</i>' and '<i>Sir Tristrem</i>' exhibit, in the notes, (now and then
thickly studded with black-letter references) a proof that the author
of '<i>The Lay</i>,' '<i>Marmion</i>,' and '<i>The Lady of the Lake</i>,' has not
disdained to enrich his stores with such intelligence as black-letter
books impart. In short, although this be a strong and general symptom
of the Bibliomania, it is certainly not attended with injurious
effects when regulated by prudence and discretion. An
undistinguishable voracious appetite to swallow <i>every thing</i>, because
printed in the black-letter, must necessarily bring on an incurable
disease, and, consequently, premature dissolution.</p>

<p class="bp">There is yet one other, and a somewhat generally prevailing, symptom,
indicative of the prevalence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span> Bibliomania; and this consists in
a fondness for books which have been printed for <span class="smcap">Private
Distribution</span><a name="FNanchor_456_464" id="FNanchor_456_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_464" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> only, or at a <span class="smcap">private press</span>. What is executed for a
few, will be coveted by many; because the edge of curiosity is
whetted, from a supposition that something very extraordinary, or very
curious, or very uncommon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span> is propagated in this said book, so
partially distributed. As to works printed at a <i>Private Press</i>, we
have had a very recent testimony of the avidity with which certain
volumes, executed in this manner, and of which the impression has been
comparatively limited, have been sought after by book <i>Cognoscenti</i>.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_456_464" id="Footnote_456_464"></a><a href="#FNanchor_456_464">[456]</a> The reader may not object to be made
acquainted with a few distinguished productions, printed for
<span class="smcap">private distribution</span>. The reader is indebted to Mr. Bulmer,
at whose elegant press these works were printed, for the
information which follows:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Museum Worsleyanum</span>; by Sir
<i>Richard Worsley</i>; 1798, 1802, Atlas Folio, 2 vols. The
first volume of this work, of which 200 copies were printed,
was finished in May, 1798, and circulated, with the plates
only of vol. ii., amongst the chosen friends of Sir Richard
Worsley, the author; who was, at that time, the diplomatic
Resident at Venice from our Court. The second volume, with
the letter-press complete, of which only 100 copies were
printed, was finished in 1802. The entire expense attending
this rare and sumptuous publication (of which a copy is in
the library of the Royal Institution) amounted to the
enormous sum of 27,000<i>l.</i> and from the irregularity of
delivering the second volume of plates, in the first
instance, without the letter-press, many of the copies are
incomplete.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Father's Revenge</span>; <i>by the Earl of
Carlisle, K.G.</i> &amp;c., 1800, 4to. A limited impression of this
very beautiful volume, decorated with engravings from the
pencil of Westall, was circulated by the noble author among
his friends. I saw a copy of it, bound in green morocco,
with the original letter of the donor, in the library of
Earl Spencer at Althorp.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mount St. Gothard</span>: <i>By the late
Duchess of Devonshire</i>, folio. Only fifty copies of this
brilliant volume were printed; to a few of which, it is
said, Lady Diana Beauclerc lent the aid of her ornamental
pencil, in some beautiful drawings of the wild and romantic
scenery in the neighbourhood of Mount St.
Gothard.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dissertation on Etruscan Vases</span>; <i>by Mr.
Christie</i>. Imperial 4to. With elegant Engravings. Only 100
copies of this truly classical volume were printed. From the
death of one or two of the parties, who became originally
possessed of it, as a present from the author, it has fallen
to the lot of Mr. Christie to become, professionally, the
vender of a work which he himself never meant to be sold. A
copy was very lately disposed of, in this manner, for
14<i>l.</i>&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bentleii Epistolæ</span>; <i>Edited by</i> [the Rev.] <i>Dr.
Charles Burney</i>: 1807, 4to. This is one of the most
beautiful productions of the Shakspeare press; nor are the
intrinsic merits of the volume inferior to its external
splendour. The scarcer copies of it are those in medium
quarto; of which only 50 were printed: of the imperial
quarto, there were 150 executed.&mdash;I add two more similar
examples, which were not printed at the Shakspeare
press:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Baltimore's</span> <i>Gaudia Poetica</i>; Lat. Angl. et
Gall. with plates. (No date). Large quarto. Only ten copies
of this rare volume were printed, and those distributed
among the author's friends: a copy of it was sold for 6<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> at the sale of Mr. Reed's books: see Bibl. Reed,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 6682. It was inserted for sale in the catalogue of
Mr. Burnham, bookseller at Northampton, A.D. 1796&mdash;with a
note of its rarity subjoined.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Views in Orkney</span> and on the
<span class="smcap">North-Eastern Coast of Scotland</span>. Taken in 1805. Etched 1807.
Folio. <i>By the Marchioness of Stafford.</i>&mdash;The letter-press
consists of twenty-seven pages: the first of which bears
this unassuming designation; "Some Account of the Orkney
Islands, extracted from Dr. Barry's History, and Wallace's
and Brand's Descriptions of Orkney." To this chapter or
division is prefixed a vignette of <i>Stroma</i>; and the chapter
ends at p. 5. Then follow four views of the Orkney
Islands.&mdash;The next chapter is entitled "The Cathedral of
Kirkwall," which at the beginning exhibits a vignette of the
<i>Cathedral of St. Magnus</i>, and at the close, at p. 9, a
vignette of a <i>Tomb in the Cathedral</i>. To these succeed two
plates, presenting Views of the <i>Inside of the Cathedral</i>,
and an <i>Arch in the Cathedral</i>.&mdash;The third chapter commences
at p. 11, with "The Earl of Orkney's Palace," to which a
vignette of a <i>Street in Kirkwall</i> is prefixed. It ends at
p. 12, and is followed by a plate exhibiting a view of the
<i>Door-way of the Earl's Palace</i>; by another of the <i>Hall of
the Earl's Palace</i>; and by a third containing two Views,
namely, the <i>Inside of the Hall</i>, and, upon a larger scale,
the <i>Chimney in the Hall</i>.&mdash;"The Bay of the Frith" is the
subject of the fourth chapter; which exhibits at the
beginning a vignette of the <i>Hills of Hoy</i>. It closes at p.
14, with a vignette of <i>The Dwarfy Stone</i>. Then follow six
plates, containing a view of the <i>Bay of Frith</i>, a <i>View
from Hoy</i>, two views of the <i>Eastern and Western Circles of
the Stones of Stennis</i>, and two views of <i>Stromness</i>.&mdash;The
next chapter is entitled "Duncansbay or Dungsby-head," which
bears in front a vignette of <i>Wick</i>, and at the end, in p.
16, a vignette of the <i>Castle of Freswick</i>. Three plates
follow: the first presenting a view of <i>Duncansbay-Head</i>:
the second, Views of the <i>Stacks of Hemprigs</i> and the <i>Hills
of Schrabiner or Schuraben</i>; the third, a View of <i>The
Ord</i>.&mdash;"The Castle of Helmsdale" is the title of the
succeeding chapter, to which is prefixed a vignette of
<i>Helmsdale Castle</i>. It ends at p. 19, with a vignette of the
<i>Bridge of Brora</i>. Then follow two plates, presenting Views
of <i>Helmsdale Castle</i>, and the <i>Coast of Sutherland</i>.&mdash;The
subject of the next chapter is "Dunrobin Castle," (the
ancient seat of her Ladyship's ancestors, and now a
residence of her Ladyship,) which presents, at the
beginning, a vignette of <i>Dunrobin Castle</i>, and after the
close of the chapter, at p. 23, four plates; the first of
which is a View of <i>Dunrobin Castle</i> and the surrounding
scenery; the second, a smaller View of the <i>Castle</i>: the
third, a View of <i>Druid Stones</i>, with another of <i>Battle
Stones in Strathflete</i>: and the fourth, <i>Dornoch, with the
Thane's Cross</i>.&mdash;The last chapter is entitled "The Chapel of
Rosslyn," to which is prefixed a vignette of <i>Rosslyn
Chapel</i>. It is followed by four plates; the first exhibiting
a View of a <i>Column in Rosslyn Chapel</i>; the second, a
<i>Door-way in the Chapel</i>; the third, the <i>Tomb of Sir
William St. Clair</i>; and the fourth, <i>Hawthornden</i>, the
residence of the elegant and plaintive Drummond; with whose
beautiful Sonnet, to this his romantic habitation, the
volume closes:</p>

<p>Of the volume which had been thus described, only 120 copies
were printed. The Views were all drawn and etched by her
Ladyship: and are executed with a spirit and correctness
which would have done credit to the most successful disciple
of Rembrandt. A copy of the work, which had been presented
to the late Right Hon. C.F. Greville, produced, at the sale

<p>&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">ii.</span> <i>A journey into England</i>, originally written in
Latin, <i>by Paul Hentzner</i>. In the year 1598. Printed 1757.
Advertisement of 10 pages in a fine large beautiful type,
printed on paper of great delicacy. The body of the work,
which is printed in a smaller type, occupies 126 double
pages; on account of the Latin and English being on the
opposite pages, each page is marked with the same number.
Only 220 copies of this curious and elegant work were
printed.&mdash;<span class="smcap">iii.</span> <i>Fugitive Pieces in Verse and Prose. Pereunt
et Imputantur.</i> <span class="smcap">mdcclviii.</span> 8vo. Two pages of dedication "To
the Honourable Major General <span class="smcap">Henry Seymour Conway</span>:" two
pages of a table of contents, body of the work 219 pages.
Printed with the small type: and only 200 copies struck
off.&mdash;<span class="smcap">iv.</span> <i>An account of Russia as it was in the year 1710.
By Charles Lord Whitworth.</i> Printed at S.H. <span class="smcap">mdcclviii</span>, 8vo.
Advertisement 24 pages, body of this work 158&mdash;with a page
of errata, 700 copies printed. This is an interesting and
elegantly printed little volume.&mdash;<span class="smcap">v.</span> <i>A parallel, in the
manner of Plutarch, between a most celebrated man of
Florence, and one scarce ever heard of in England. By the
Reverend Mr. Spence</i>, 1758, 8vo. This is the beautiful and
curious little volume, of which mention has already been
made at <a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>, ante. Seven hundred copies of it were
printed; and from a copy, originally in the possession of
the late Mr. John Mann, of Durham, I learnt that "the clear
profits arising from the sale of it being about 300<i>l.</i>,
were applied for the benefit of Mr. Hill and his family."
(Magliabechi was "the man of Florence;" and Hill "the one
scarce ever heard of in England.") A copy of this edition,
with MS. notes by Mr. Cole, was purchased by Mr. Waldron, at
the sale of George Steevens's books, for 3<i>l.</i>6<i>s.</i> It was
reprinted by Dodsley: but the curious seek only the present
edition.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">vi.</span> <i>Lucani Pharsalia</i>, <span class="smcap">mdcclx</span>, 4to. This is the
most beautiful volume, in point of printing, which the
Strawberry Hill press ever produced. A tolerably copious
account of it will be found in my <i>Introduction to the
Classics</i>, vol. ii., p. 53. Kirgate the printer (recently
deceased) told me that uncommon pains were taken with its
typographical execution.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">vii.</span> <i>Anecdotes of Painting in</i>
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: England"><i>Englaud</i></span>; <span class="smcap">mdcclxi.</span> four
volumes; <i>Catalogue of Engravers</i>, 4to., one volume. This is
the <i>first</i>, and, on account of having the earliest
impressions of the plates, the <i>best</i> edition of this
amusing, and once popular work. It was reprinted in quarto,
in 1765; of which edition I believe 600 copies were struck
off. Again, in 1786, crown 8vo., five volumes, without the
plates.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">viii.</span> <i>The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of
Cherbury</i>, written by himself. Printed in the year <span class="smcap">mdcclxix</span>,
4to. Dedication of two pages to Lord Powis. Advertisement
six pages, not numbered. After this, there should be a
"Genealogical Table of the family of Herbert," which is very
scarce, on account of its being suppressed by Mr. Walpole,
for its inaccuracy. The life occupied 171 pages. "Mr.
Walpole," says the late Mr. Cole, "when I was with him in
the autumn of 1763, at which time the book was partly
printed, told me that either one or two hundred copies were
to be printed; half to be sent to the Earl of Powis, and the
other half he was to reserve for himself, as presents to his
friends; so that, except the book is reprinted by some
bookseller, privately, as probably it will, it will be a
curiosity. It was not published till the end of June, 1764,
when the honourable editor sent it to me.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">ix.</span> <i>Poems by
Anna Chambers</i>, Countess Temple. <span class="smcap">mdcclxiv</span>, 4to. This volume,
containing 13 poems on various subjects, is printed in 34
pages, with a large, but not very elegant type. Only 100
copies were struck off.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">x.</span> <i>The Mysterious Mother.</i> A
Tragedy, by Mr. Horace Walpole. Sit mihi fas audita loqui.
Virg. Printed at S.H., <span class="smcap">mdcclxviii.</span> 8vo. No vignette on the
back. First leaf, errata, and "persons" [of the play.]
Printed with the small type on 120 pages; after which
follows a "postscript" of 10 pages. Only 50 copies printed.

<i>Cornélie vestale. Tragédie.</i> Imprimée à S.H. <span class="smcap">mdcclxviii</span>,
8vo., 200 copies. The title-page is followed by a letter "a
Mons. Horace Walpole." A page of the names of the actors
forms the commencement of the work, which contains 91 pages,
neatly printed. Only 200 copies printed, of which 150 were
sent to Paris.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xii.</span> <i>Poems by the Reverend Mr. Hoyland</i>,
<span class="smcap">mdcclxix</span>, 8vo. The advertisement ends at p. iv.; the odes
occupy 19 pages. Although this little volume is not printed
with the usual elegance of the S.H. press, it is valuable
from its scarcity, on account of its never having been
re-printed. Only 300 copies were struck off.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xiii.</span>
<i>Original Letters from K. Edward VI. to Barnaby
Fitzpatrick</i>, 1772, 4to. I am not acquainted with any
circumstance, intrinsic or extrinsic, that renders this
small volume sought after.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xiv.</span> <i>Miscellaneous
Antiquities, or a collection of curious papers</i>: either
republished from scarce tracts, or now first printed from
original MSS. Two numbers printed by Thomas Kirgate,
<span class="smcap">mdcclxxii</span>, 4to. No. I. Advertisement of two pages, ending p.
iv. The number contains besides: <span class="smcap">Contents.</span> Chap. I. "An
account of some Tournaments and other martial Diversions."
This was reprinted from a work written by Sir William Segar,
Norroy; and is called by the author, Honour, Military and
Ceuill, printed at London in 1602. Chap. II. Of "Justs and
Tournaments," &amp;c., from the same. Chap. III. "A Triumph in
the Reigne of King Richard the Second, 1390," from the same.
Chap. IV. "A Militarie Triumph at Brussels, Anno 1549," from
the same. Chap. V. "Of Justs and Tourneaments," &amp;c., from
the same. Chap. VI. "Triumphes Military, for honour and loue
of Ladies: brought before the Kings of England," from the
same. Chap. VII. "Of the life and actions in Armes since the
reigne of Queene Elizabeth," from the same. Chap. VIII. "The
original occasions of the yeerely Triumph in England." All
these tracts are taken from the above work. No. II. Second
leaf, a plate of a head from the original wood-cut by Hans
Holbein. <span class="smcap">Contents.</span> This number is almost entirely occupied
by the "Life of Sir Thomas Wyat, the elder," copied by Mr.
Gray from the originals in the Harleian Collection, now in
the British Museum. This extends to p. 54, after which is an
Appendix of eight pages on a few miscellaneous subjects.
Five hundred copies were printed.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xv.</span> <i>Memoirs du Comte
de Grammont</i>, par Monsieur le Comte Antoine Hamilton.
Nouvelle edition, Augumentée denotes et eclaircissemens
necessaires. Par <span class="smcap">M. Horace Walpole</span>. <span class="smcap">mdcclxxii</span>, 4to. The
title-page is succeeded by a dedication "à Madame &mdash;&mdash;," in
six lines and a half, printed in a very large type. Then
follows an "Avis de L'Editour," and "Avertissement,"
occupying three pages. An "Epitre à Monsieur le Comte de
Grammont,' continues to p. xxi: then a "Table des
Chapitres," to p. xxiii., on the back of which are the
errata. The body of the work extends to 290 pages; which are
succeeded by "Table des Personnes," or index, in three
pages. These memoirs are printed with the middle size type;
but neither the type nor paper are so beautiful as are those
of Hentzner's Travels, or the comparison between Magliabechi
and Hill. <span class="smcap">Portraits.</span> 1. Le Comte Antoine Hamilton, faces the
title page. 2. Philibert, Comte de Grammont, opposite the
"Epitre:" badly executed. 3. A portrait of Miss Warminster,
opposite p. 85, in the style of Worlidge's gems. 4.
Mademoiselle d'Hamilton, Comtesse de Grammont, faces p. 92.
This engraving, by G. Powle, is executed in a style of
beauty and spirit that has seldom been surpassed. 5. Lord
Chesterfield, second Earl, in the style of the preceding;
very beautiful. There were only 100 copies of this edition
printed, of which 30 were sent as presents to Paris.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xvi.</span>

on 56 pages, exclusively of viii. introductory ones, of
"prologues" and "persons," &amp;c. Only 75 copies were printed:
and of these, one was sold for 4<i>l.</i> in the year 1804, at a
public auction.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xvii.</span> <i>A Letter to the Editor of the

very elegantly printed. Only 200 copies.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xviii.</span> <i>The Muse

<span class="smcap">mdcclxxxi</span>. 4to. Eight pages, exclusively of the title-page.
Printed in the middle size type; but neither the paper nor
typographical execution are in the best style of the S.H.
press. Only 250 copies printed.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xix.</span> <i>A Description of

<p class="center">The following may amuse the curious reader:</p>

<p>"Mr. Walpole is very ready to oblige any curious persons
with the sight of his house and collection; but as it is
situated so near to London, and in so populous a
neighbourhood, and as he refuses a ticket to nobody that
sends for one, it is but reasonable that such persons as
send should comply with the rules he has been obliged to lay
down for shewing it:&mdash;Any person, sending a day or two
before may have a ticket for four persons for a day
certain;&mdash;No Ticket will serve but on the day for which it
is given. If more than four persons come with a ticket, the
housekeeper has positive orders to admit none of
them;&mdash;Every ticket will admit the company only between the
hours of twelve and three before dinner, and only one
company will be admitted on the same day;&mdash;The house will
never be shewn after dinner, nor at all but from the first
of May to the first of October;&mdash;As Mr. Walpole has given
offence by sometimes enlarging the number
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: of">o</span> four, and refusing that latitude to others, he
flatters himself that for the future nobody will take it ill
that he strictly confines the number; as whoever desires him
to break his rule does in effect expect him to disoblige
others, which is what nobody has a right to desire of
him;&mdash;Persons desiring a ticket may apply either to
Strawberry Hill, or to Mr. Walpole's, in Berkeley Square,
London. If any person does not make use of the ticket, Mr.
Walpole hopes he shall have notice: otherwise he is
prevented from obliging others on that day, and thence is
put to great inconvenience;&mdash;They who have tickets are
desired not to bring children."&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xx.</span> <i>A copy of all the
Works of Mr. Walpole that were printed by him before his
death</i>, 1784, 4to. This brochure, which has been called
"rare" in book-auction catalogues, has been sold for upwards
of two guineas.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xxi.</span> <i>Postscript to the Royal and Noble
Authors.</i> <span class="smcap">mdccxxxvi</span>, 8vo. There should be, before the
title-page, an outline etching of "Reason, Rectitude, and
Justice, appearing to Christin de Pisan, &amp;c., from an
illumination in the library of the King of France," which is
exceedingly well engraved. The work contains only 18 pages:
and there were but 40 copies printed. The <i>Royal and Noble
Authors</i> were first printed in 1759, 8vo. 2 vols.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xxii.</span>
<i>Essai sur l'Art des Jardins Modernes</i>, par M. Horace

par T. Kirgate, <span class="smcap">mdcclxxxv</span>. With an opposite title in
English, 4to. It contains 94 double pages, and every page of
French has an opposite one of English. Not printed in the
best manner of S.H. A copy of this book was sold for 3<i>l.</i>;
at a sale in 1804.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xxiii.</span> <i>Bishop Banner's Ghost.</i>
Printed by T.K. <span class="smcap">mdlccxxxix</span>, 4to. On the first leaf is the
following "Argument." "In the gardens of the palace of
Fulham is a dark recess: at the end of this stands a chair,
which once belonged to Bishop Bonner. A certain Bishop of
London (the late Beilby Porteus) more than 200 years after
the death of the aforesaid Bonner, just as the clock of the
gothic chapel had struck six, undertook to cut, with his own
hand, a narrow walk through this thicket, which is since
called the <i>Monk's walk</i>. He had no sooner begun to clear
the way, than lo! suddenly up started from the chair, the
ghost of Bishop Bonner, who, in a tone of just and bitter
indignation, uttered the following verses." This curious
publication contains only four pages of stanzas, written in
alternate rhyme, of 8 and 6 feet metre.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xxiv.</span> <i>The Magpie
and her Brood</i>; a fable, from the tales of Bonaventure de
Periers, valet de chambre to the Queen of Navarre; addressed
to Miss Hotham. This is a very scarce poetical tract of four
pages only; subscribed H.W.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xxv.</span> <i>Fourteen different
pieces, printed at Strawberry Hill, of verses, cards, &amp;c.</i>
This title I borrow from a book-auction catalogue. At a sale
in 1804, these detached pieces were sold for 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>;
but it is not in my power to identify them. Whether they be
the same "<i>parcel of scraps, and loose leaves of poetry,
epigrams</i>," <i>&amp;c.</i> which, according to a daily newspaper,
were sold at the commencement of this year "for 16 pounds,"
I am also equally ignorant. See <i>Kirgate's Catalogue</i>, 1810,
n<span class="super">o</span>. 420.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xxvi.</span> <i>Hieroglyphic Tales</i>, 8vo. Only seven
copies printed; <i>idem</i>, n<span class="super">o</span>. 380. From newspaper
authority, I learn that these tales formed "a small pamphlet
of two sheets, crown 8vo.," which were sold for 16<i>l.</i>; and
I understand that the late Mr. G. Baker was the purchaser.
N.B. They are incorporated in the author's printed works;
but this is not having the <i>first</i> and <i>true edition</i>! There
is nothing like the comfort of bleeding smartly for
exhibiting these fourth and fifth symptoms of the
Bibliomania! Vide pp. <a href="#Page_521">521</a>, <a href="#Page_525">525</a>, ante.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">xxvii.</span> <i>Additions

seven articles are taken from Mr. Cuthell's catalogue of
1811.] I should add that a much more copious and complete
list, though not possessing all the intelligence here
communicated, was prepared by the late Mr. George Baker for
press; and printed, since his decease, for donations to his
particular friends. Only twenty copies of this
bibliographical brochure are said to have been executed. We
will now take leave of the <span class="smcap">Prelum Walpolianum</span> by subjoining
a copy of the most elegant title-page vignette which ever
issued from it.

</p>

<p>Before the reader's eyes are finally turned from a
contemplation of this elegant device&mdash;and as connected with
the subject of <span class="smcap">Private Presses</span>&mdash;let me inform him that the
Marquis of Bute is in possession of a thin folio volume,
exhibiting paintings, upon vellum, of the various devices
used by Pope Sixtus V., in the frontispieces of the several
works which issued from the <span class="smcap">Apostolical Press</span>, while he
filled the Papal Chair. To a tasteful bibliomaniac, few
volumes would afford so much delight as a contemplation of
the present one. It is quite a <i>keimelion</i> in its way!</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Lysand</span>. I do; but I have not so ardent an admira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>tion of these
volumes, as the generality of collectors. On the contrary, I think
that the <i>Hafod Press</i> has, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span> one single production only, outweighed
the whole of the <i>Walpolian</i> lucubrations; at least on the score of
utility.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span></p>

<p>I might here add, to the foregoing symptoms, a passion to possess
works which have been <i>suppressed</i>, <i>condemned</i>, or <i>burnt</i>; but all
these things rank under the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span> <i>causes of the rarity</i> of books;
and as an entire volume might be written upon <i>this</i> symptom <i>alone</i>,
I can here only allude to <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: superfluous 'to'">to</span> the subject; hoping some diligent
biblio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>grapher will one day do for <i>us</i> what foreigners have done for
other nations.</p>

<p>Thus have I, rather slightly, discussed the <i>Symptoms of the Disease,
called</i> <span class="rl">The Bibliomania</span>. During this discussion, I see our friend has
been busy, as he was yesterday evening, in making sketches of notes;
and if you examine the finished pictures of which such outlines may be
made productive, you will probably have a better notion of the
accuracy of my classification of these symptoms.</p>

<p>It is much to be wished, whatever may be the whims of desperate
book-collectors, that, in <i>some</i> of those volumes which are constantly
circulating in the bibliomaniacal market, we had a more clear and
satisfactory account of the rise and progress of arts and sciences.
However strong may be my attachment to the profession of the cloth, I
could readily exchange a great number of old volumes of polemical and
hortatory divinity for interesting disquisitions upon the manners,
customs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span> general history of the times. Over what a dark and
troublesome ocean must we sail, before we get even a glimpse at the
progressive improvement of our ancestors in civilised life! Oh, that
some judicious and faithful reporter had lived three hundred and odd
years ago!&mdash;we might then have had a more satisfactory account of the
<i>origin of printing with metal types</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Pray give us your sentiments upon this latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span> subject. We have
almost the whole day before us:&mdash;the sun has hardly begun to decline
from his highest point.</p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> A very pretty and smooth subject to discuss, truly! The
longest day and the most effectually-renovated powers of body and
mind, are hardly sufficient to come to any satisfactory conclusion,
upon the subject. How can I, therefore, after the fatigues of the
whole of yesterday, and with barely seven hours of daylight yet to
follow, pretend to enter upon it? No: I will here only barely mention
<span class="smcap">Trithemius</span><a name="FNanchor_458_466" id="FNanchor_458_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_466" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>&mdash;who might have been numbered among the patriarchal
bibliographers we noticed when discoursing in our friend's <span class="smcap">Cabinet</span>&mdash;as
an author from whom considerable assistance has been received
respecting early typographical researches. Indeed, Trithemius merits a
more marked distinction in the annals of Literature than many are
supposed to grant him: at any rate, I wish his labours were better
known to our own countrymen.</p>

intelligence; and however Scioppius (<i>De Orig. Domûs
Austriac.</i>), Brower (<i>Vit. Fortunat. Pictav.</i>, p. 18.), and
Possevinus (<i>Apparant sacr.</i> p. 945), may carp at his
simplicity and want of judgment, yet, as Baillet (from whom
I have borrowed the foregoing authorities) has justly
remarked&mdash;"since the time of Trithemius there have been many
libraries, particularly in Germany, which have been pillaged
or burnt in the destruction of monasteries; so that the
books which he describes as having seen in many places,
purposely visited by him for inspection, may have been
destroyed in the conflagration of religious houses."
<i>Jugemens des Savans</i>; vol. ii., pt. i., p. 71, edit. 12mo.
It is from Trithemius, after all, that we have the only
<i>direct</i> evidence concerning the origin of printing with
metal types: and the bibliographical world is much indebted
to Chevelier (<i>L'Origine de l'Imprimerie de Paris</i>, 1691,
4to., pp. 3-6.) for having been the first to adduce the
positive evidence of this writer; who tells us, in his
valuable <i>Chronicon Hirsaugiens</i> (1690, 2 vols. folio), that
he received his testimony from the mouth of Fust's
son-in-law&mdash;"ex ore Petri Opilionis audivi,"&mdash;that
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Gutenberg">Guttenburg</span> was the author of
the invention. The historical works of Trithemius were
collected and published in 1601, in folio, two parts, and
his other works are minutely detailed in the 9th volume of
the <span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Dictionnaire"><i>Dictionnarie</i></span>
<i>Historique</i>, published at Caen, in 1789. Of these, one of
the most curious is his <i>Polygraphia</i>: being first printed
at Paris, in 1518, in a beautiful folio volume; and
presenting us, in the frontispiece, with a portrait of the
abbé; which is probably the first, if not the only
legitimate, print of him extant. Whether it be copied from a
figure on his tomb&mdash;as it has a good deal of the
<i>monumental</i> character&mdash;I have no means of ascertaining. For
the gratification of all tasteful bibliomaniacs, an
admirable facsimile is here annexed. The <i>Polygraphia</i> of
Trithemius was translated into French, and published in
1601, folio. His work <i>De Scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis</i>,
Colon, 1546, 4to., with two appendices, contains much
valuable matter. The author died in his 55th year, A.D.
1516: according to the inscription upon his tomb in the
monastery of the Benedictines at Wirtzburg. His life has
been written by Busæus, a Jesuit. See La Monnoye's note in
the <i>Jugemens des Savans</i>; <i>ibid.</i>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Let me consider. Yes; there is one other characteristic of the

collect <span class="smcap">all the editions</span> of a work which have been published. Not only
the <span class="smcap">first</span>&mdash;whether <i>uncut, upon large paper</i>, <i>in the black-letter</i>,

desperately afflicted with this <i>eleventh</i> symptom of <i>The
Bibliomania</i>; having collected not fewer than <i>seventy-five</i>
editions of the <span class="smcap">Greek Testament</span>&mdash;but time has cooled my
ardour, and mended my judgment. I have discarded seventy,
and retain only five: which are <i>R. Steevens's</i> of 1550,
<i>The Elzevir</i> of 1624, <i>Mill's</i> of 1707, <i>Westein's</i> of

throng, who turn their blue eyes to the scarcely bluer expanse of

<p><a name="Footnote_460_468" id="Footnote_460_468"></a><a href="#FNanchor_460_468">[460]</a> Some superficial notes, accompanied by an
interesting wood-cut of a man carrying hawks for sale, in my
edition of Robinson's translation of <i>More's Utopia</i>,
kindled, in the breast of Mr. Joseph Haslewood, a prodigious
ardour to pursue the subjects above-mentioned to their
farthest possible limits. Not Eolus himself excited greater
commotion in the Mediterranean waves than did my
bibliomaniacal friend in agitating the black-letter
ocean&mdash;'a sedibus imis'&mdash;for the discovering of every volume
which had been published upon these delectable pursuits.
Accordingly there appeared in due time&mdash;'[post] magni
procedere menses'&mdash;some very ingenious and elaborate
disquisitions upon Hunting and Hawking and Fishing, in the
ninth and tenth volumes of <i>The Censura Literaria</i>; which,
with such additions as his enlarged experience has
subsequently obtained, might be thought an interesting work
if reprinted in a duodecimo volume. But Mr. Haslewood's
mind, as was to be expected, could not rest satisfied with
what he considered as mere <i>nuclei</i> productions:
accordingly, it became clothed with larger wings, and
meditated a bolder flight; and after soaring in a
<i>hawk</i>-like manner, to mark the object of its prey, it
pounced upon the book of <i>Hawking, Hunting, Fishing, &amp;c.</i>,
which had been reprinted by W. de Worde, from the original
edition published in the abbey of St. Albans. Prefixed to
the republication of this curious volume, the reader will
discover a great deal of laborious and successful research
connected with the book and its author. And yet I question
whether, in the midst of all the wood-cuts with which it
abounds, there be found any thing more suitable to the 'high
and mounting spirit' (see Braithwait's amusing discourse
upon Hawking, in his <i>English Gentleman</i>, p. 200-1.) of the
editor's taste, than the ensuing representation of a pilgrim
Hawker?!&mdash;taken from one of the frontispieces of <i>L'Acadamia

<p>These are pretty lines, and have a melodious flow; but
Ronsard, in his 8 and 9 feet metres, is one of the most
fascinating of the old French poets. The subject, above
alluded to by Lysander, may be yet more strongly
illustrated: for thus speaks Spizelius upon it. 'Solent viri

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> Well; we live in a marvellous book-collecting and book-reading
age&mdash;yet a word more:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> I crave your pardon, Belinda; but I have a thought which must
be now imparted, or the consequence may be serious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> I wait both your commands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> My thought&mdash;or rather the subject which now occupies my
mind&mdash;is this: You have told us of the symptoms of the <i>Disease of
Book-Madness</i>, now pray inform us, as a tender-hearted physician, what
are the <i>means of its cure</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> The very question I was about to put to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span> bibliomaniacal
physician. Pray inform us what are the means of cure in this disorder?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> You should say <span class="smcap">Probable Means of Cure</span>, as I verily believe
there are no certain and correct remedies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> Well, Sir, <i>probable</i> means&mdash;if it must be so. Discourse
largely and distinctly upon these.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> Briefly and perspicuously, if you please: and thus we begin.</p>

<p>In the <i>first place</i>, the disease of the Bibliomania is materially
softened, or rendered mild, by directing our studies to <i>useful</i> and
<i>profitable</i> works; whether these be printed upon small or large
paper, in the gothic, roman, or italic type. To consider merely the
<i>intrinsic excellence</i>, and not the <i>exterior splendour</i>, or
adventitious value, of any production will keep us perhaps wholly free
from this disease. Let the midnight lamp be burnt to illuminate the
stores of antiquity&mdash;whether they be romances, or chronicles, or
legends, and whether they be printed by <span class="smcap">Aldus</span> or <span class="smcap">Caxton</span>&mdash;if a brighter
lustre can thence be thrown upon the pages of modern learning! To
trace genius to its source, or to see how she has been influenced or
modified by the lore of past times, is both a pleasing and profitable
pursuit. To see how Shakspeare, here and there, has plucked a flower
from some old ballad or popular tale, to enrich his own unperishable
garland;&mdash;to follow Spenser and Milton in their delightful labyrinths
'midst the splendour of Italian literature; are studies which stamp a
dignity upon our intellectual characters! But, in such a pursuit, let
us not overlook the wisdom of modern times, nor fancy that what is
only ancient can be excellent. We must remember that Bacon, Boyle,
Locke, Taylor, Chillingworth, Robertson, Hume, Gibbon, and Paley, are
names which always command attention from the wise, and remind us of
the improved state of reason and acquired knowledge during the two
last centuries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alman.</span> There seems at least sound sense, with the prospect of much
future good, in this <i>first</i> recipe. What is your second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Lysand</span>. In the <i>second place</i>, the reprinting of scarce and
intrinsically valuable works is another means of preventing the
propagation of this disorder. Amidst all our present sufferings under
the <span class="smcap">Bibliomania</span>, it is some consolation to find discerning and
spirited booksellers republishing the ancient Chroniclers; and the
collections known by the names of "<i>The Harleian Miscellany</i>" and
"<i>Lord Somers' Tracts</i>," and "<i>The Voyages of Hakluyt</i>."<a name="FNanchor_464_472" id="FNanchor_464_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_472" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> These
are noble efforts, and richly deserve the public patronage.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_464_472" id="Footnote_464_472"></a><a href="#FNanchor_464_472">[464]</a> In the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for August, 1810,
this my second remedy for curing the disease of the
Bibliomania is considered as inefficient. I have a great
respect for this Review, but I understand neither the
premises nor conclusions therein laid down concerning the
subject in discussion. If "those who cannot afford to
purchase original publications must be content with entire
reprints of them" (I give the very words, though not the
entire sentence), it surely tends to lessen the degree of
competition for "the original publication." A sober reader,
or an economical book-buyer, wants a certain tract on the
ground of its utility:&mdash;but take my own case&mdash;who have very
few hundreds per annum to procure food for the body as well
as the mind. I wish to consult Roy's tract of "Rede me and
be not wroth," (vide <a href="#Page_226">p. 226</a>, ante)&mdash;or the "Expedition into
Scotland" of 1544 (see Mr. Beloe's <i>Anecdotes of Literature
and Scarce Books</i>, vol. ii., p. 345), because these are
really interesting, as well as rare, volumes. There is at
present no reprint of either; and can I afford to bid ten or
twelve guineas for each of them at a public book-sale?
But&mdash;let them be faithfully <i>reprinted</i>, and even a golden
guinea (if such a coin be now in the pocket of a poor
bibliomaniac like myself) would be considered by me as
<i>dear</i> terms upon which to purchase the <i>original</i> edition!
The reviewer has illustrated his position by a model of the
Pigot diamond; and intimates that this model does not
"lessen the public desire to possess the original." Lord
Mansfield once observed that nothing more frequently tended
to perplex an argument than a simile&mdash;(the remark is
somewhere in <i>Burrows's Reports</i>); and the judge's dictum
seems here a little verified. If the glass or crystal model
could reflect <i>all the lustre</i> of the original, it would be
of equal utility; but it cannot. Now the reprint <i>does</i>
impart <i>all</i> the intelligence and intrinsic worth of the
original (for "the ugliness of the types" cannot be thought
worthy of aiding the argument one way or another) therefore
the reprint of Roy's poetical tract is not illustrated by
the model of the Pigot diamond: which latter cannot impart
the intrinsic value of the original. Let us now say a word
about the <i>Reprints</i> above commended by Lysander. When Mr.
Harding went to press with the first volume of the <i>Harleian
Miscellany</i>, his zeal struggled with his prudence about the
number of copies to be printed of so voluminous a work.
Accordingly, he ventured upon only 250 copies. As the work
advanced, (and, I would hope, as the recommendation of it,
in the last edition of the Bibliomania, promoted its sale)
he took courage, and struck off another 250 copies of the
earlier volumes: and thus this magnificent reprint (which
will be followed up by two volumes of additional matter
collected by Mr. Park, its editor) may be pronounced a
profitable, as well as generally serviceable, publication to
the cause of Literature. The original edition of <i>Lord
Somers' Tracts</i> having become exceedingly scarce, and the
arrangement of them being equally confused, three spirited
booksellers, under the editorial inspection of Mr. Walter
Scott, are putting forth a correct, well arranged, and
beautiful reprint of the same invaluable work. Five volumes
are already published. <i>The Voyages of Hakluyt</i> are
republishing by Mr. Evans, of Pall Mall. Four volumes are
already before the public; of which only 250 copies of the
small, and 75 of the large, are printed. The reprint will
contain the whole of Hakluyt, with the addition of several
scarce voyages and travels.</p>

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Yet forgive me if I avow that this same country, whose editorial
labours you are thus commending, is shamefully deficient in the
cultivation of <i>Ancient English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span> History</i>! I speak my sentiments
roundly upon this subject: because you know, Lysander, how vigilantly
I have cultivated it, and how long and keenly I have expressed my
regret at the almost total apathy which prevails respecting it. There
is no country upon earth which has a more plentiful or faithful stock
of historians than our own; and if it were only to discover how
superficially some of our recent and popular historians have written
upon it, it were surely worth the labour of investigation to examine
the yet existing records of past ages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loren.</span> To effect this completely, you should have a <span class="smcap">National Press</span>.</p>

<i>Diction. Historique</i>, vol. i. p. 109.
</p><p>
Peignot, in his <i>Dictionnaire de Bibliologie</i>, vol. i. 50,
has given a very pompous account of what ought to be the
talents and duties of a bibliographer. It would be difficult
indeed to find such qualifications, as he describes, united
in one person! De Bure, in the eighth volume of his
<i>Bibliographie Instructive</i>, has prefixed a "Discourse upon
the Science of Bibliography, and the Duties of a
Bibliographer," which is worth consulting: but I know of
nothing which better describes, in few words, such a
character, than the following: "In eo sit multijuga
materiarum librorumque notitia, ut saltem potiores eligat et
inquirat: fida et sedula apud exteras gentes procuratio, ut
eos arcessat; summa patientia ut rarè venalis expectet;
peculium semper præsens et paratum, ne, si quando occurrunt,
emendi, occasio intercidat: prudens denique auri argentique
contemptus, ut pecuniis sponte careat quæ in bibliothecam
formandam et nutriendam sunt insumendæ. Si forte vir
literatus eo felicitatis pervenit ut talem thesaurum
coacervaverit, nec solus illo invidiose fruatur, sed usam
cum eruditis qui virgilias suas utilitati publicæ
devoverunt, liberaliter communicet;" &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Bibliotheca
Hulsiana</i>, vol. i. Præfat. p. 3, 4. Morhof abounds with
sagacious reflections upon this important subject: but are
there fifty men in Great Britain who love to read the
<i>Polyhistor Literarius</i>? The observations of Ameilhon and
Camus, in the <i>Memoires de l'Institut</i>, are also well worth
consultation; as are those of Le Long, and his editor,
prefixed to the last edition of the <i>Bibliotheca Sacra</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span><span class="smcap">Lis.</span> Excellent!&mdash;Treat copiously upon this my darling subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belin.</span> You speak with the enthusiasm of a young convert; but I should
think the study of Bibliography a sure means of increasing the
violence of the book-disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lysand.</span> The encouragement of <i>the Study of Bibliography</i>, in its
legitimate sense, and towards its true object, may be numbered among
the most efficacious cures for this destructive malady. To place
competent Librarians over the several departments of a large public
Library; or to submit a library, on a more confined scale, to one
diligent, enthusiastic, well-informed, and well-bred Bibliographer or
Librarian (of which in this metropolis we have so many examples), is
doing a vast deal towards directing the channels of literature to flow
in their proper courses. And thus I close the account of my recipes
for the cure of the Bibliomania. A few words more and I have done.</p>

<p class="bp">It is, my friends, in the erection of Libraries as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span> literary
compositions, the task is difficult, and will generally meet with
opposition from some fastidious quarter,<a name="FNanchor_468_476" id="FNanchor_468_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_476" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> which is always
betraying a fretful anxiety to bring every thing to its own ideal
standard of perfection. To counteract the unpleasant effect which such
an impression must necessarily produce, be diligent and faithful, to
your utmost ability, in whatsoever you undertake. You need not evince
the fecundity of a German<a name="FNanchor_469_477" id="FNanchor_469_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_477" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> author; but only exert your best
endeavours, and leave the issue to a future generation. Posterity will
weigh, in even scales, your merits and demerits, when all present
animosities and personal prejudices shall have subsided; and when the
utility of our labours, whether in promoting wisdom or virtue, shall
be unreservedly acknowledged. You may sleep in peace before this
decision take place; but <span class="smcap">your children</span> may live to witness it; and
your name, in consequence, become a passport for them into circles of
learning and worth. Let us now retreat; or, rather, walk round
Lorenzo's grounds. We have had <i>Book-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>Discussion</i> enough to last us to

'comme un brave homme' upon the difficulty of literary
enterprizes, and the facility and venom of detraction: I
support his assertion 'totis viribus'; and to beg to speak
in the same person with himself. 'Non ignotum mihi est,
quantæ molis opus humeris meis incumbat. Oceanum enim
ingressus sum, in quo portum invenire difficile est,
naufragii periculum à syrtibus et scopulis imminet. Quis
enim in tanta multitudine rerum et librorum omnia

invidia caput retraheret, ac malignitatis dentes in

sentiments thus:&mdash;'laborem hunc meum non periculosum minus

of the Roman philosophers (I think it was Seneca) said, in
his last moments, 'Whether or not the Gods will be pleased
with what I have done, I cannot take upon me to pronounce:
but, this I know&mdash;it has been my invariable object to please
them.' For 'the Gods' read 'the Public'&mdash;and then I beg

Seneca.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dear Sir,</span></p>

<p class="letter">I take the liberty presuming upon the Intimacy of our
Acquaintance to employ you in a pretty troublesome Affair.
Fletcher Gyles, Bookseller in Holbourn, with whom I had some
Dealings about two years ago, has lately sent me Down a
Catalogue of a Library which will begin to be sold by
Auction at his house next Monday Evening. As I have scarce
laid out any Money in Books for these two years past, the
great number of Valuable Books contained in this Collection,
together with the tempting prospect of getting them cheaper
in an Auction than they are to be had in a Sale, or in any
other way whatsoever, has induced me to lay out a Sum of
mony this way, at present, which will probably content my
Curiosity in this kind, for several years to come. Mr. Gyles
has offered himself to act for me, but as I think 'tis too
great a Trial of his Honesty to make him at the same time
both Buyer &amp; Seller, &amp; as Books are quite out of my
Brother's Way, I have been able to think of no Friend I
could throw this trouble upon but you. I propose to lay out
about £60 or £70, and have drawn up a List of the Books I am
inclined to, which you have in the First Leaf, with the
Price to each Book, which I would by no means exceed, but as
far as which, with respect to each single Book, I would
venture to go; though I am persuaded upon the whole they are
vastly overvalued. For my Valuation is founded in proportion
upon what I have been charged for Books of this kind, when I
have sent for them on purpose from London, and I have had
too many proofs that the Booksellers make it a Rule to
charge near double for an uncommon Book, when sent for on
purpose, of what they would take for it in their own Shops,
or at a Sale. So that, though the Amount of the Inclosed
List is above £120, yet, when Deductions are made for the
Savings by the Chance of the Auction, &amp; for the full rate of
such Books as I may be over bid in, I am satisfied it will
come within the sum I propose. Now, Sir, the Favour which I
would beg of you is to get some Trusty Person (&amp; if you
should not be able readily to think of a proper Person
yourself, Mr. Hinchcliffe or Mr. Peele may probably be able
to recommend one) to attend this Auction, in my behalf, from
the beginning to the end, &amp; to bid for me agreeably to the
inclosed List &amp; (as the Additional Trouble of it over and
above the Attendance would not be great) to mark in the
Catalogue, which you may have of Mr. Gyles for a shilling,
the price Every Book contained in the Catalogue is sold at,
for my future Direction in these Matters. For this Service I
would willingly allow 3 Guineas, which, the Auction
continuing 24 Days, is 3 shillings over and above half a
Crown a Day; or, if that is not sufficient, whatever more
shall be thought necessary to get my Commission well
Executed. It may be necessary to observe to you that the
Auction requires the Attendance of the whole day, beginning
at Eleven in the Morning, and ending at two and at five in
the Afternoon, and Ending at Eight. It may also be proper to
inform the Person you shall Employ that he is not to govern
his first bidding by the valuation in my list for many of
the Books will very probably be sold for less than half what
I have marked them at; he is therefore, in every Instance,
to bid Low at first, and afterwards to continue advancing
just beyond the other Bidders, till he has either bought the
Book, or the price I have fixed it at is exceeded. There are
many Books in the List which have several numbers before
them; the meaning of which is that the very same Book is in
several places of the Catalogue; and in that Case, I would
have the first of them bought, if it be in very good
condition, otherwise let the person Employed wait till the
other comes up. I would desire him also not to buy any book
at all that is both Dirty &amp; ragged; but, though the Binding
should not be in very good Order, that would be no Objection
with me, provided the Book was clean. I would also desire
him not to bid for any Number in the Catalogue that is not
expressly mentioned in my List, upon a supposition that it
may be the same Book with some that are mentioned in it; nor
to omitt any Book that is actually upon the List, upon an
Imagination, from the Title, that it may be there more than
once; for I have drawn it up upon an Exact consideration of
the Editions of the Books, insomuch that there is no Book
twice upon the List, but where there is a very great
difference in the Editions; nor is any of the Books in my
List oftener in the Catalogue than is expressly specified in
it. By the Conditions of Sale, the Auction is constantly
adjourned from Fryday night to Monday Morning, the Saturday
being appointed for fetching away, at the Expence of the
buyer, the Books bought the week before, &amp; for payment of
the Mony. This part of the trouble I must beg you to charge
yourself with; &amp;, in order to enable you, as to the payment,
I shall send you up, either by the next Post, or, however,
time enough for the Saturday following, Fifty Pounds. I
would beg the Favour of you to let me hear from you, if
possible, by the Return of the Post; &amp; also to give me an
Account by every Saturday night's post what Books are bought
for me, and at what price. As to which you need only mention
the Numbers without the Titles, since I have a Catalogue by
me. When the Auction is Ended, I shall take the Liberty of
giving you farther Directions about Packing up the Books, &amp;
the way I would have them sent down. When I drew up my List,
I had not observed one of the Conditions of Sale, which
imports that no Person is to advance less than a shilling
after twenty shillings is bid for any book. Now you will
find a pretty many Books which I have valued at more than
twenty shillings marked at an Odd Sixpence; in all which
Cases, I would have the Bidder add Sixpence more to the
Price I have fixed, in order to make it Even Money, &amp;
conformable to the Conditions of the Auction. And now, Dear
Sir, another Person would make a thousand Apologies for
giving you all this trouble; all which superfluous
tediousness I shall spare you, being persuaded I shall do
you a great pleasure in giving you an Opportunity of being
serviceable to me, as I am sure it would be a very sensible
one to me, if I ever had it in my power to be of any use to
you. Mine and my Wive's humble respects wait upon Mrs. Mann,
and you will be so good to present my hearty services to all
our Friends.</p>

<p>Lysander concluded; when Lorenzo rose from his seat, and begged of us
to walk round his grounds. It was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span> high noon; and, after a
pleasant stroll, we retreated again to <span class="smcap">the alcove</span>, where we found a
cold collation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span> prepared for our reception. The same day we all dined
at Lisardo's; and a discussion upon the pleasures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span> comparative
excellences of <i>Music</i> and <i>Painting</i> succeeded to the conversation
which the foregoing pages have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span> detailed. A small concert in the

resolved to equal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span> if not eclipse, his bibliographical tutor in the
ardour of book researches. "Adieu," said Lysander, putting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span> hand
out of the chaise&mdash;"remember, in defence of my bibliomaniacal

chaise, following the direction of the road to the left, quickly
disappeared. The servant of Lysander followed gently after, with his
Master's and Philemon's horses: taking a near direction towards
Lysander's home.</p>

visible upon all our countenances; and the Ladies confessed that the
company and conversation of my departed guests, especially of
Lysander, were such as to leave a void which could not easily be
supplied. For my part, from some little warmth each sister betrayed in
balancing the solid instruction of Lysander and the humorous vivacity
of Lisardo, against each other, I thought the former had made a
powerful impression upon the mind of Belinda, and the latter upon that
of Almansa: for when the probability of a speedy revisit from both of
them was mentioned the sisters betrayed unusual marks of sensibility;
and upon Lorenzo's frankly confessing, though in a playful mood, that
such brothers-in-law would make him "as happy as the day was
long"&mdash;they both turned their faces towards the garden, and appeared
as awkward as it was possible for well-bred ladies to appear.</p>

<p>It was in vain that I turned to my library and opened a large paper,
illustrated, copy of Daulby's <i>Catalogue of Rembrandt's Prints</i>, or
Mr. Miller's new edition of the <i>Memoirs of Count Grammont</i>, or even
the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>, printed by Galliot du Pré, <span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>....
Nothing produced a kind look or a gracious word from them. Silence,
sorrow, and indifference, succeeded to loquacity, joy, and enthusiasm.
I clearly perceived that some <i>other</i> symptom, wholly different from
any thing connected with the Bibliomania, had taken possession of
their gentle minds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span></p>

coldness of my opinion in regard to books printed by Pynson upon
vellum. The painted ornaments, in Lord Spencer's copy, were, in all
probability, executed abroad. The art, in our own country, was then
too rude for such elegance of decoration.</p>

scenery and the dialogue of this Part are more especially
<i>Waltonian</i>. The characters are few; but <span class="smcap">Lysander</span> must of necessity be
the Author&mdash;as he is the principal actor in the scene, and throughout
the entire work the principal intelligence is derived from his lips.
The scene itself is not absolutely ideal. At the little village of
&mdash;&mdash;, upon the upper grounds, near Marlow, and necessarily commanding
a sweep of the Thames in one of its most richly wooded windings, there
lived a Mr. Jacobs, the friend of the adjoining Rector, whose table
was as bounteous as his heart was hospitable; and whose frequent
custom it was, in summer months, to elicit sweet discourse from his
guests, as they sauntered, after an early supper, to inhale the
fragrance of "dewy eve," and to witness the ascendancy of the moon in
a cool and cloudless sky. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span> have partaken more than once of these
"Tusculan" discussions; and have heard sounds, and witnessed
happiness, such as is not likely to be my lot again. <span class="smcap">Philemon</span> is at
rest in his grave, as well as <span class="smcap">Menander</span> and <span class="smcap">Sicorax</span>. The two latter, it
is well known, were Tom Warton and Joseph Ritson. "The husband of poor
Lavinia" was a most amiable gentleman, but timid to a morbid excess.
Without strong powers of intellect, he was tenacious of every thing
which he advanced, and yet the farthest possible from dogmatic
rudeness. There are cankers that eat into the <i>heart</i> as well as the
cheek; and because Mr. Shacklewell (the <span class="smcap">Nicas</span> of my text) happened to
discover a few unimportant errors in that husband's last performance,
the latter not only thought much and often about it, but seemed to
take it seriously to heart, and scarcely survived it a twelvemonth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gonzalo</span>, mentioned at <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>, was a Mr. Jessop; an exceedingly
lively, inoffensive, but not over wise gentleman; a coxcomb to excess
in every thing; but not without vivacious parts, which occasionally
pleased, from the <i>manner</i> in which they were exhibited. Of handsome
person and fluent speech, he was generally acceptable to the fair sex;
but he made no strong <i>individual</i> impression, as he was known to use
the same current phrases and current compliments to all. Just possible
it was that his personal attractions and ready utterance were
beginning to strike a <i>root</i> or two in some one female bosom; but it
was impossible for these roots to penetrate deeply, and take an
<i>exclusive</i> hold. I believe Mr. Jessop quitted the neighbourhood of
Marlow shortly after the publication of the Bibliomania, to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
thither no more. <span class="smcap">Alfonso</span> was a Mr. Morell; a name well known in
Oxfordshire. He was always in the <i>same</i> false position, from the
beginning to the end; but I am not sure whether this be not better
than a perpetually shifting false position. Disguise it as you may, an
obstinate man is preferable to a <i>trimmer</i>; be he a common man, or an
uncommon man; a layman or a clergyman; "in crape," or "in lawn."</p>

<p>The compliment paid by Lysander (at pages <a href="#Page_18">18</a>, <a href="#Page_19">19</a>) to Dr. <span class="smcap">Vincent</span>, late
Dean of Westminster, and head master of Westminster School, were
acknowledged by that venerable and most worthy, as well as erudite,
character, in a letter to me, which I deemed it but an act of justice
to its author to publish in the <i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>, vol. iii.
p. 353. Poor Mr. <span class="smcap">Barker</span> (Edmund Henry), who is handsomely mentioned in
the Dean's letter, has very lately taken his departure from us, for
<i>that</i> quiet which he could not find upon earth. "Take him for all in
all" he was a very extraordinary man. Irritable to excess; but ardent
and ambitious in his literary career. His industry, when, as in former
days, it was at its height, would have killed half the scholars of the
time. How he attained his fiftieth year, may be deemed miraculous;
considering upon what a tempestuous sea his vessel of life seemed to
be embarked. Latterly, he took to politics; when&mdash;"farewell the
tranquil mind!"</p>

<h3>THE CABINET.</h3>


<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">This</span> portion of the "Bibliomania," embracing about fourscore pages,
contains a <i>Précis</i>, or review of the more popular works, then extant,
upon <span class="smcap">Bibliography</span>. It forms an immense mass of materials; which, if
expanded in the ordinary form of publication, would alone make a
volume. I have well nigh forgotten the names of some of the more
ancient heroes of bibliographical renown, but still seem to cling with
a natural fondness to those of Gesner, Morhof, Maittaire, and
Fabricius: while Labbe, Lambecius, and Montfauçon, Le Long, and
Baillet, even yet retain all their ancient respect and popularity. As
no <i>fresh characters</i> are introduced in this second part of the
Bibliomania, it may be permitted me to say a word or two upon the
substance of the materials which it contains.</p>

<p>The immense note upon the "<i>Catalogue of Libraries</i>," alphabetically
arranged, from <a href="#Page_72">page 72</a> to <a href="#Page_99">page 99</a>, is now, necessarily, imperfect;
from the number of libraries which have been subsequently sold or
described. Among the <i>latter</i>, I hope I may naturally, and
justifiably, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span> mention of the <span class="smcap">Bibliotheca Spenceriana</span>; or, A
descriptive Catalogue of the early printed Books of the late George
John Earl Spencer, K.G.; comprising, in the whole, seven volumes; with
the addition of the Cassano Library, or books purchased of the Duke of
Cassano, by the noble Earl, when at Naples, in the year 1819. In the
"<i>Reminiscences of my Literary Life</i>," I have given a sort of graphic
description of this extensive work, and of the circumstances attending
its publication. <i>That</i> work now rests upon its own particular, and, I
will fearlessly add, solid, basis. For accuracy, learning, splendour,
and almost interminable embellishment, it may seem at once to command
the attention, and to challenge the commendation, of the most
fastidious: but it is a flower which blooms more kindly in a foreign,
than in its native, soil. It has obtained for me the notice and the
applause of learned <i>foreigners</i>; and when I travelled abroad I
received but too substantial proofs that what was slighted <i>here</i> was
appreciated in <i>foreign</i> parts. Our more popular Reviews, which seem
to thrive and fatten best upon lean fare, passed this magnificent work
over in a sort of sly or sullen silence; and there is no record of its
existence in those of our Journals which affect to strike the key-note
only of what is valuable in science, literature, and the fine arts.
Painful as it must ever be to my feelings to contrast the avidity of
former purchasers to become possessed of it with the caprice and
non-chalance which have marked the conduct of those possessors
themselves, I will yet hope that, in the bosom of the <span class="smcap">Successor</span> to
this matchless Library&mdash;as well as to the name and fortunes of its
late owner&mdash;there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span> ever remain but <i>one feeling</i>, such as no
misconception and no casualty will serve to efface. It is pleasing,
yea, soothing, 'midst the buffetting surges of later life, to be able
to keep the anchor of one's vessel <i>well bit</i> in the interstices of
granite.</p>

<p>Much later than the publication last alluded to, were the sale
catalogues of the Libraries of Sir <span class="smcap">Mark Masterman Sykes</span>, Bart.,
deceased; the Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry Drury</span>; <span class="smcap">George Hibbert</span>, Esq., deceased; and
Sir <span class="smcap">Francis Freeling</span>, Bart., deceased. They were all sold by Mr.
Evans, of Pall Mall; as well indeed as was the Library of the late
Duke of Marlborough, when Marquis of Blandford. What books! And what
prices! It should seem that "there were giants," both in purse and
magnitude of metal, "in those days!" But a mighty "man in valour" has
recently sprung up amongst us; who, spurning the acquisition of
solitary <i>lots</i>, darts down upon a whole <i>Library</i>, and bears it off
"at one fell swoop." Long life to the spirit which possesses him! It
is almost a national redemption.</p>

<h2><a href="#PART_III">PART III.</a></h2>

<h3>THE AUCTION-ROOM.</h3>


<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">We</span> are here introduced into one of the most bustling and
spirit-stirring portions of the whole Work. It is full of
characters&mdash;alas! now, with only <i>two</i> exceptions, mouldering in their
coffins! Philemon (who was one of my earliest and steadiest friends)
introduces us to a character, which, under the name of <span class="smcap">Orlando</span>, made
some impression upon the public, as it was thought to represent
<span class="smcap">Michael Wodhull</span>, Esq., of Thenford Hall, near Banbury; an admirable
Greek scholar (the translator of Euripides), and perhaps the most
learned bibliographer of his age. The conjecture of Orlando being the
representative of Mr. Wodhull was not a vain conjecture; although
there were, necessarily (I will not say <i>why</i>), parts that slightly
varied from the original. Mr. Wodhull re-appears, in his natural
person, in the <i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>, vol. iii. p. 363-6. Since
the publication of that work, a curious history attaches to his
memory. Within a twelvemonth of the expiration of the statute of
limitation, an action at law, in the shape of an ejectment, was set on
foot by a neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span> family, to dispossess the present rightful
occupant, <span class="smcap">S.A. Severne</span>, Esq., of the beautiful domain of Thenford; to
ransack the Library; to scatter abroad pictures and curiosities of
every description; on the alleged ground of insanity, or incompetency
to make a will, on the part of Mr. Wodhull. As I had been very minute
in the account of Mr. Wodhull's person, in the work just alluded to, I
became a <i>witness</i> in the cause; and, as it was brought into Chancery,
my deposition was accordingly taken. I could have neither reluctance
nor disinclination to meet the call of my excellent friend, Mr.
Severne; as I was abundantly confident that the charge of
"incompetency to make a will" could not rest upon the slightest
foundation. It was insinuated, indeed, that the sister-in-law, Miss
Ingram, had forged Mr. Wodhull's name to the will.</p>

<p>Such a conspiracy, to defraud an honourable man and legitimate
descendant of his property, is hardly upon record; for, waiting the
accidents that might occur by death, or otherwise, in the lapse of
twenty years, the cause was brought into the Vice Chancellor's Court
with the most sanguine hope of success. I was present during one of
the days of argument, and heard my own letter read, of which I had
(contrary to my usual habits) taken a copy. The plaintiffs had written
to me (suppressing the fact of the intended action), requesting to
have my opinion as to Mr. Wodhull's capability. I returned such an
answer as truth dictated. The Counsel for the plaintiffs (<i>ut mos
est</i>) showered down upon the defendant every epithet connected with
base fraud and low cunning, of which the contents of the brief seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
to warrant the avowal. In due course, Sir Knight Bruce, now one of the
supernumerary Vice Chancellors, rose to reply. His speech was one
undisturbed stream of unclouded narrative and irresistible reasoning.
The Vice Chancellor (Shadwell) gave judgment; and my amiable and
excellent friend, Mr. Severne, was not only to return in triumph to
the mansion and to the groves which had been built and planted by his
venerable ancestor, Mr. Wodhull, but he was strongly advised, by the
incorruptible judge on the bench, to bring an action against the
plaintiffs for one of the foulest conspiracies that had ever been
developed in a court of justice. The defendant might have transported
the whole kit of them. But the <i>giving</i> advice, and the <i>following</i> it
when given, are two essentially different things. A <span class="smcap">thousand guineas</span>
had been already expended on the part of Mr. Severne! When does my
Lord Brougham <i>really</i> mean to reform the law? A recent publication
("Cranmer, a Novel") has said, "that he applies <i>sedatives</i>, when he
should have recourse to <i>operations</i>."</p>

<p class="bp">But the reader must now hurry with me into "The Auction Room." Of the
whole group there represented, full of life and of action, <span class="smcap">two only</span>
remain to talk of the conquests achieved!<a name="FNanchor_472_480" id="FNanchor_472_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_480" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> And Mr. Hamper,
too&mdash;whose note, at <a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a>, is beyond all price&mdash;has been lately
"gathered to his fathers." "Ibimus, ibimus!" But for our book-heroes
in the Auction Room.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_472_480" id="Footnote_472_480"></a><a href="#FNanchor_472_480">[472]</a> Before mention made of the Auction Room,
there is a long and particular account of the "<i>Lectionum
Memorabilium et Reconditarum Centenarii XVI.</i>" by John Wolf,
in 1600, folio; with a fac simile, by myself, of the
portrait of the Author. It had a great effect, at the time,
in causing copies of this work to be sedulously sought for
and sold at extravagant prices. I have known a fine copy of
this ugly book bring £8 8<i>s.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="tp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>The first in years, as well as in celebrity, is <span class="smcap">Lepidus</span>; the
representative of the late Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Gosset</span>. In the <i>Bibliographical
Decameron</i>, vol. iii. p. 5, ample mention is made of him; and here it
is, to me, an equally grateful and delightful task to record the
worth, as well as the existence, of his two sons, Isaac and Thomas,
each a minister of the Church of England. The former is covered with
<i>olive branches</i> as well as with reputation; while the latter,
declining the "branches" in question, rests upon the stem of his own
inflexible worth, and solid scholastic attainments. Mrs. Gardiner, the
wife of a Major Gardiner, is the only daughter of Dr. Gosset; a wife,
but not a mother. The second in the ranks is <span class="smcap">Mustapha</span>. Every body
quickly found out the original in Mr. Gardiner, a bookseller in Pall
Mall; who quickly set about repelling the attack here made upon him,
by a long note appended to the article "Bibliomania," in one of his
catalogues. Gardiner never lacked courage; but, poor man! his brains
were under no controul. We <i>met</i> after this reply, and, to the best of
my recollection, we exchanged ... <i>smiles</i>. The catalogue in question,
not otherwise worth a stiver, has been sold as high as 15s., in
consequence of the Dibdinian flagellation. Poor Gardiner! his end was
most deplorable.</p>

<p>We approach <span class="smcap">Bernardo</span>, who was intended to represent the late Mr.
<span class="smcap">Joseph Haslewood</span>; and of whose book-fame a very particular, and I
would hope impartial, account will be found in the "<i>Literary
Reminiscences of my Literary Life</i>." There is no one portion of that
work which affords me more lively satisfaction on a re-perusal. The
cause of the <i>individual</i> was merged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span> in the cause of <i>truth</i>. The
strangest compound of the strangest materials that ever haunted a
human brain, poor Bernardo was, in spite of himself, a man of <i>note</i>
towards his latter days. Every body wondered what was in him; but
something, certainly worth the perusal; oozed out of him in his
various motley performances; and especially in his edition of Drunken
Barnaby's Tour, which exhibited the rare spectacle of an accurate
Latin (as well as English) text, by an individual who did not know the
dative singular from the dative plural of <i>hic, hæc, hoc</i>! Haslewood,
however, "hit the right nail upon the head" when he found out the
<i>real</i> author Barnaby, in Richard Brathwait; from the unvarying
designation of "<i>On the Errata</i>," at the end of Brathwait's pieces,
which is observable in that of his "<i>Drunken Barnaby's Tour</i>." It was
an <span class="err" lang="el" title="Greek: eurêcha; Transcriber's Note: should be &#949;&#965;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;, 'eurêka'">&#949;&#965;&#961;&#951;&#967;&#945;</span> in its way;
and the late Mr. Heber used to shout aloud, "stick to <i>that</i>,
Haslewood, and your fame is fixed!" He was always proud of it; but
lost sight of it sadly, as well as of almost every thing else, when he
composed "<i>The Roxburghe Revels</i>." Yet what could justify the cruelty
of dragging this piece of private absurdity before the public
tribunal, on the death of its author? Even in the grave our best
friends may be our worst foes.</p>

<p>At <a href="#Page_196">page 196</a> we are introduced to <span class="smcap">Quisquilius</span>, the then intended
representative of Mr. George Baker, of St. Paul's Churchyard; whose
prints and graphic curiosities were sold after his death for several
thousand pounds. Mr. Baker did not survive the publication of the
Bibliomania; but it is said he got scent of his delineated character,
which ruffled every feather of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span> plumage. He was thin-skinned to
excess; and, as far as that went, a <i>Heautontomorumenos</i>! Will this
word "re-animate his clay?"</p>

<p>The "short gentleman," called <span class="smcap">Rosicrusius</span>, at <a href="#Page_127">page 127</a>, must
necessarily be the author of the work. He has not grown <i>taller</i> since
its publication, and his coffers continue to retain the same stinted
condition as his person. Yet what has he not <i>produced</i> since that
representation of his person? How has it pleased a gracious Providence
to endow him with mental and bodily health and stamina, to prosecute
labours, and to surmount difficulties, which might have broken the
hearts, as well as the backs, of many a wight "from five to ten inches
taller than himself!" I desire to be grateful for this prolongation of
labour as well as of life; and it will be my heart-felt consolation,
even to my dying hour, that such "labour" will be acceptable to the
latest posterity.</p>

<p>Yet a word or two by way of epilogue. The "Reminiscences" contain a
catalogue raisonné of such works as were published up to the year
1836. Since then the author has not been idle. The "<i>Tour into the
North of England and Scotland</i>," in two super-royal octavos, studded
with graphic gems of a variety of description&mdash;and dedicated to the
most illustrious female in Europe, for the magnificence of a library,
the fruit chiefly of her own enterprise and liberality&mdash;has at least
proved and maintained the spirit by which he has been long actuated.
To re-animate a slumbering taste, to bring back the gay and gallant
feelings of past times, to make men feel as gentlemen in the
substitution of <i>guineas</i> for <i>shillings</i>, still to uphold the beauty
of the press, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span> splendour of marginal magnitude, were, alone,
objects worthy an experiment to accomplish. But this work had other
and stronger claims to public notice and patronage; and it did not
fail to receive them. Six hundred copies were irrevocably fixed in the
course of the first eighteen months from the day of publication, and
the price of the large paper has attained the sum of £12. 12<i>s.</i>
Strange circumstances have, however, here and there, thrown dark
shadows across the progress of the sale.</p>

<p>If it were pleasing to the Author, in the course of his Journey, to
receive attentions, and to acknowledge hospitalities, from the gay and
the great, it were yet more pleasing to hope and to believe that such
attentions and hospitalities had been acknowledged with feelings and
expressions becoming the character of a gentleman. They have been so;
as the pages of the work abundantly testify. But English courtesy is
too frequently <i>located</i>. It is a coin with a feeble impress, and
seems subject to woful attrition in its circulation. The countenance,
which beams with complacency on receiving a guest to enliven a dull
residence, in a desolate neighbourhood, is oftentimes overcharged with
sadness, or collapses into rigidity, if the same guest should come
under recognizance in a populous city. When I write "Instructions for
an Author on his travels," I will advise a measured civility and a
constrained homage:&mdash;to criticise fearlessly, and to praise sparingly.
There are hearts too obtuse for the operations of gratitude. The
Scotch have behaved worthy of the inhabitants of the "land of cakes."
In spirit I am ever present with them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span> rambling 'midst their
mountains and passes. If an Author may criticise his own works, I
should say that the preface to the Scotch Tour is the best piece of
composition of which I have been ever guilty.</p>

<p class="bp">How little are people aware of the pleasure they sometimes
unconsciously afford! When Mr. James Bohn, the publisher of the Scotch
Tour, placed me, one day, accidentally, opposite a long list of
splendidly bound books, and asked me "if I were acquainted with their
author?" I could not help inwardly exclaiming ... "<span class="smcap">Non omnis
Moriar</span>!"<a name="FNanchor_473_481" id="FNanchor_473_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_481" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> I am too poor to present them to my "Sovereign Mistress,
the Queen Victoria;" but I <i>did</i> present her Majesty, in person, with
a magnificently bound copy of the <i>Scotch Tour</i>; of which the
acceptance was never acknowledged from the royal quarter; simply
because, according to an etiquette which seems to me to be utterly
incomprehensible, books presented <i>in person</i> are not acknowledged by
the Donee. I will not presume to quarrel with what I do not exactly
understand; but I will be free to confess that, had I been <i>aware</i> of
this mystery, I should have told her Majesty, on presenting the
volume, that "I had the greater pleasure in making the offering, as
her illustrious Father had been among the earliest and warmest patrons
of my book-career; and that the work in question contained no
faithless account of one of the most interesting portions of her
dominions." This copy for the Queen had a special vellum page, on
which the Dedication, or Inscription, was printed in letters of gold.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_473_481" id="Footnote_473_481"></a><a href="#FNanchor_473_481">[473]</a> This magnificent set of books, not <i>all</i> upon
large paper, was valued at £84. It has been since sold to
Lord Bradford.</p>
</div>

<p class="tbp"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>At length we approach the once far-famed <span class="smcap">Atticus</span>: the once illustrious
<span class="smcap">Richard Heber</span>, Esq., the self-ejected member of the University of
Oxford. Even yet I scarcely know how to handle this subject, or to
expatiate upon a theme so extraordinary, and so provocative of the
most contradictory feelings. But it were better to be brief; as, in
fact, a very long account of Mr. Heber's later life will be found in
my <i>Reminiscences</i>, and there is little to add to what those pages
contain. It may be here only necessary to make mention of the sale of
his wonderful library; wonderful in all respects&mdash;not less from the
variety and importance of its contents, than from the unparalleled
number of <i>duplicate volumes</i>&mdash;even of works of the first degree of
rarity. Of the latter, it may suffice to observe that, of the editio
princeps of <i>Plato</i>, there were not fewer than <i>ten</i> copies; and of
that of <i>Aristotle</i>, five or six copies: each the production of the
Aldine Press. Several of these Platonic copies were, to my knowledge,
beautiful ones; and what more than <i>one</i> such "beautiful copy" need
mortal man desire to possess? I believe the copy of the Plato bought
at the sale of Dr. Heath's library in 1810 was, upon the whole, the
most desirable.<a name="FNanchor_474_482" id="FNanchor_474_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_482" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Both works are from the press of the elder Aldus.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_474_482" id="Footnote_474_482"></a><a href="#FNanchor_474_482">[474]</a> The Rt. Hon. Thomas Grenville possesses a
copy of this first edition (from the library of the Rev.
Theodore Williams) in an <i>uncut</i> state. It may defy all
competition. There is, however, in the Spencer library, at
Althorp, described by me in the second volume of the
Bibliotheca <i>Spenceriana</i>, a very beautiful copy, delicately
ruled with red lines, which may be pronounced as almost in
its primitive state. The leaves "discourse most eloquently"
as you turn them over: and what sound, to the ears of a
thorough bred bibliomaniac, can be more "musical?"</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">It may be observed, as mere preliminary matter, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span> it was once in
contemplation to publish the literary life of Mr. Heber; and an
impression comes across my mind that I had tendered my services for
the labour in question. The plan was however abandoned&mdash;and perhaps
wisely. There was also to have been a portrait prefixed, from the
pencil of Mr. Masquerier, the <i>only</i> portrait of him&mdash;in later
life&mdash;but the strangest whims and vagaries attended the surrendering,
or rather the <i>not</i> surrendering, of the portrait in question. I am in
possession of a correspondence upon this subject which is perfectly
<i>sui generis</i>. The library of Mr. Heber was consigned to the care and
discretion of Messrs. Payne and Foss&mdash;booksellers of long established
eminence and respectability. It was merely intended to be an
alphabetical, sale catalogue, with no other bibliographical details
than the scarcity or curiosity of the article warranted. It was also
of importance to press the sale, or sales, with all convenient
dispatch: but the mass of books was so enormous that two years
(1834-6) were consumed in the dispersion of them, at home; to say
nothing of what was sold in Flanders, at Paris, and at Neuremberg. I
have of late been abundantly persuaded that the acquisition of
books&mdash;anywhere, and of whatever kind&mdash;became an ungovernable passion
with Mr. Heber; and that he was a <span class="smcap">Bibliomaniac</span> in its strict as well
as enlarged sense. Of his library at Neuremberg he had never seen a
volume; but he thought well of it, as it was the identical collection
referred to by Panzer, among his other authorities, in his
Typographical Annals. Of the amount of its produce, when sold, I am
ignorant.</p>

<p>I have said that the Catalogue, which consisted of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span> XII parts
(exclusively of a portion of foreign books, which were sold by the
late Mr. Wheatley) was intended merely to be a sale catalogue, without
bibliographical remarks; but I must except Parts II, IV, and XI: the
first of these containing the <i>Drama</i>, the second the <i>English
Poetry</i>, and the third the <i>Manuscripts</i>&mdash;which, comparatively,
luxuriate in copious and apposite description. "Si sic omnia!" but it
were impracticable. I believe that the Manuscript Department,
comprised in about 1720 articles, produced upwards of £5000. It may
not be amiss to subjoin the following programme.</p>

<p class="bp">From which it should seem, first that the total number of <i>articles</i>
was nearly <i>fifty three thousand</i>&mdash;a number that almost staggers
belief; and places the collections of Tom Rawlinson and the Earl of
Oxford at a very considerable distance behind; although the latter,
for <i>condition</i> (with <span class="smcap">one</span> exception), has never been equalled, and
perhaps will probably never be surpassed. Secondly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span> if it be a
<i>legitimate</i> mode of computation&mdash;taking two books for each article,
one with another, throughout the entire catalogue&mdash;it will follow that
the entire library of Mr. Heber, in England, contained not fewer than
<i>one hundred and five thousand volumes</i>. The <i>net</i> amount of the <span class="smcap">Sale</span>
of this unparalleled mass of books is said to have been £55,000: a
large sum, when the deductions from commissionship and the
government-tax be taken into consideration.<a name="FNanchor_475_483" id="FNanchor_475_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_483" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Dr. Harwood thought
that the sale of Askew Library was a remarkable one, from its bringing
a guinea per article&mdash;one with another&mdash;of the 4015 articles of which
the library was composed. The <i>history</i> of the Heber Sale might
furnish materials for a little jocund volume, which can have nothing
to do here; although there is more than <i>one</i> party, mixed up with the
tale, who will find anything but cause of <i>mirth</i> in the recital. That
such a <span class="smcap">Monument</span>, as this library, should have been suffered to crumble
to pieces, without a syllable said of its owner, is, of all the
marvellous occurrences in this marvellous world, one of the most
marvellous: and to be deprecated to the latest hour. Yet, who was
surrounded by a larger troop of friends than the Individual who raised
the Monument?</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<p><a name="Footnote_475_483" id="Footnote_475_483"></a><a href="#FNanchor_475_483">[475]</a> These deductions, united, are about 17 per
cent.: nearly £10,000 to be deducted from the gross
proceeds.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">One anecdote may be worth recording. The present venerable and deeply
learned President of Magdalen College, Oxford, told me that, on
casting up the number of odd&mdash;or appendant volumes, (as 2 or 12 more)
to the several articles in the catalogue&mdash;he found it to amount to
<i>four thousand</i>. Now, primâ facie, it seems hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span> credible that
there should have been <i>such</i> a number, in <i>such</i> a library, not
deserving of mention as distinct articles: but it must be taken into
consideration that Mr. Heber bought <i>many</i> lots for the sake of <i>one</i>
particular book: and, considering the enormous extent of his library,
it is not a very violent supposition, or inference, that these 4000
volumes were scarcely deserving of a more particular notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pontevallo</span> was the late <span class="smcap">John Dent</span>, Esq., whose library was sold in
1827; and of which library that of the late Robert Heathcote formed
the basis. It contained much that was curious, scarce, and delectable;
but the sale of it exhibited the first grand melancholy symptoms of
the decay of the Bibliomania. The Sweynheym and Pannartz Livy of 1469,
<span class="smcap">upon vellum</span>, was allowed to be knocked down for £262! Mr. Evans, who
had twice before sold that identical volume&mdash;first, in the sale of Mr.
Edwards's library (see <i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>, vol. iii. p.&mdash;)
and secondly in that of the late Sir M.M. Sykes, Bart, (who had
purchased the book for £782)&mdash;did all that human powers could do, to
obtain a higher bidding&mdash;but Messrs. Payne and Foss, with little more
than the <i>breathing</i> of competition, became the purchasers at the very
moderate sum first mentioned. From them it seemed to glide naturally,
as well as necessarily, into the matchless collection of the Rt. Hon.
Thomas Grenville. I yet seem to hear the echo of the clapping of Sir
M.M. Sykes's hands, when I was the herald of the intelligence of his
having become the purchaser! These echoes have all died away <i>now</i>:
unless indeed they are likely to be revived by a <span class="smcap">Holford</span> or a
<span class="smcap">Bottfield</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span></p>

<p>Hortensius was the late Sir <span class="smcap">William Bolland</span>, Knt.: and, a few years
before his death, one of the Barons of his Majesty's Exchequer. He
died in his 68th year. He was an admirable man in all respects. I
leave those who composed the domestic circle of which he was the
delightful focus, to expatiate upon that worth and excellence of which
they were the constant witnesses and participators&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"He best shall <i>paint</i> them who shall <i>feel</i> them most."</p>

<p>To me, the humbler task is assigned of recording what is only more
particularly connected with <span class="smcap">books</span> and <span class="smcap">virtu</span>. And yet I may, not very
inappositely, make a previous remark. On obtaining a seat upon the
bench, the first circuit assigned to him was that of "the Oxford." It
proved to be heavy in the criminal Calendar: and Mr. Baron Bolland had
to pass sentence of death upon three criminals. A maiden circuit is
rarely so marked; and I have reason to believe that the humane and
warm-hearted feelings of the Judge were never before, or afterwards,
subjected to so severe a trial. It was a bitter and severe struggle
with all the kindlier feelings of his heart. But our theme is <span class="smcap">books</span>.
His library was sold by public auction, under Mr. Evans's hammer, in
the autumn of 1840. One anecdote, connected with his books, is worth
recording. In my Decameron, vol. iii. p. 267, mention will be found of
a bundle of poetical tracts, belonging to the Chapter-library at
Lincoln, round which, on my second visit to that library, I had, in
imitation of Captain Cox (see page &mdash; ante), entwined some whip-cord
around them&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>setting them apart for the consideration of the Dean and
Chapter, whether a <i>second</i> time, I might not become a purchaser of
some of their book-treasures? I had valued them at fourscore guineas.
The books in question will be found mentioned in a note at page 267 of
the third volume of the Bibliographical Decameron.</p>

<p>I had observed as follows in the work just referred to, "What would
Hortensius say to the gathering of such flowers, to add to the
previously collected <i>Lincoln Nosegay</i>?" The reader will judge of my
mingled pleasure and surprise (dashed however with a few grains of
disappointment on not becoming the proprietor of them <i>myself</i>) when
the Baron, one day, after dining with him, led me to his book-case,
and pointing to these precious tomes, asked me if I had ever seen them
<i>before</i>? For a little moment I felt the "Obstupui" of Æneas. "How is
this?" exclaimed I. "The secret is in the vault of the
Capulets"&mdash;replied my Friend&mdash;and it never escaped him. "Those <span class="smcap">are</span> the
identical books mentioned in your Decameron." Not many years
afterwards I learnt from the late Benjamin Wheatley that <i>he</i> had
procured them on a late visit to Lincoln; and that <i>my</i> price,
affixed, was taken as their just value. Of these
<span class="err" title="Transcriber's Note: Lincolnian">Linclonian</span> treasures, one volume alone&mdash;the Rape
of Lucrece&mdash;brought <span class="smcap">one hundred guineas</span> at the sale of the Judge's
library, beginning on the 18th of November, 1840. See No. 2187; where
it should seem that only four other perfect copies are known.</p>

<p>The library of the late Mr. Baron Bolland, consisting of 2940
articles, brought a trifle <i>more</i> than a guinea per article. It was
choice, curious, and instructively mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>cellaneous. Its owner was a man
of taste as well as a scholar; and the crabbed niceties of his
profession had neither chilled his heart nor clouded his judgment. He
revelled in his small cabinet of English Coins; which he placed, and
almost worshipped, among his fire-side lares. They were, the greater
part of them, of precious die&mdash;in primitive lustre; and he handled
them, and expatiated on them, with the enthusiasm of a Snelling, and
the science of a Foulkes. His walls were covered with modern pictures,
attractive from historical or tasteful associations. There was nothing
but what seemed to</p>

<p class="center">"point a moral, or adorn a tale."</p>

<p>His passion for books was of the largest scale and dimensions, and
marked by every species of almost enviable enthusiasm. His anecdotes,
engrafted on them, were racy and sparkling; and I am not quite sure
whether it was not in contemplation by him to build a small
"<i>oratoire</i>" to the memories of Caxton and Wynkyn De Worde. He
considered the folios of the latter, in the fifteenth century, to be
miracles of typographical execution; and, being a poet himself, would
have been in veritable ecstacies had he lived to see the <span class="smcap">unique
Chaucer</span> of 1498, which it was my good luck to obtain for the library
of the Rt. Hon. Thomas Grenville. I will add but a few specimens of
his library&mdash;</p>

and velvet bound tomes are seen to yet greater advantage. <span class="smcap">Leontes</span>,
mentioned at page 133, was the late <span class="smcap">James Bindley</span>, Esq.&mdash;of whom a few
interesting particulars will be found in the third volume of my
<i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>. He died before the publication of this
latter work. Sir <span class="smcap">Tristrem</span> was the late Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>&mdash;then in the
effulgence of poetical renown! <span class="smcap">Prospero</span> was the late <span class="smcap">Francis Douce</span>,
Esq. My Reminiscences make copious mention of these celebrated
characters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aurelius</span> was intended as the representative of the late <span class="smcap">George
Chalmers</span>, Esq.&mdash;the most learned and the most celebrated of all the
Antiquarians and Historians of Scotland. His <span class="smcap">Caledonia</span> is a triumphant
proof of his giant-powers. Never before did an author encounter such
vast and various difficulties: never was such thick darkness so
satisfactorily dispersed. It is a marvellous work, in four large
quarto volumes; but so indifferently printed, and upon such wretched
paper, that within the next century, perhaps, not six copies of it
will be found entire. The less laborious works of Mr. Chalmers were
statistical and philological. Of the latter, his tracts relating to
<i>Shakspeare</i>, and his Life of <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i> may be considered
the principal.</p>

<p>On the death of Mr. George Chalmers in 1823, his nephew became
possessed of his library; and on the death of the nephew, in 1841, it
was placed by the executors in the hands of Mr. Evans, who brought
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span> first part to sale on the 27th of September, 1841. It consisted
of 2292 articles, and produced the sum of £2190. The Second Part was
brought to the same hammer, on February 27, 1842, and produced the sum
of £1918 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> It is on the <i>latter</i> part that I am disposed to
dwell more particularly, because it was so eminently rich in
Shakspearian lore; and because, at this present moment, the name of
our immortal dramatist seems to be invested with a fresh halo of
incomparable lustre. The first edition of his smaller works has
acquired most extraordinary worth in the book-market. The second part
of Mr. Chalmers's collection shews that the <i>Sonnets</i> of 1595 produced
a hundred guineas; while the <i>Rape of Lucrece</i> (which, perhaps, no
human being has ever had the perseverance to read through) produced
£105 in a preceding sale: see page 591. The <i>Venus and Adonis</i> has
kept close pace with its companions.</p>

<p>We may now revel among the rarities of the <span class="smcap">first part</span> of this
extraordinary collection&mdash;</p>

<p>[In my earlier days of Book-collecting, I obtained a copy of this most
rare volume, in an <i>uncut state</i>, from a Mr. Keene, of Hammersmith,
who asked me "if I thought <i>half-a-guinea</i> an extravagant price for
it?" I unhesitatingly replied in the negative. Not long after, the
late Mr. Sancho, who succeeded Mr. Payne, at the Mews Gate, went on
his knees to me, to purchase it for <i>two guineas</i>! His attitude was
too humble and the tone of his voice too supplicatory to be resisted.
He disposed of it to his patron-friend, the Hon. S. Elliott, for five
pounds five shillings. Mr. Elliott had a very choice library; and was
himself a most amiable and incomparable man. It is some twenty-five
years since I first saw him at the late Earl Spencer's, at Althorp.]</p>

<p>Gabriel Harvey was the intimate friend of Spenser. The immediate
occasion of Harvey's writing these letters was to resent Greene's
attack on his Father; but the permanent value of the Volume is the
very interesting notices Harvey gives of his literary contemporaries.
The work concludes with a Sonnet of Spenser, addressed to Harvey.</p>

Pestilence. The Tales of my Landlord then follow, "Where the Fatte

acquisition of the <i>latter</i> copy is one of singular interest; almost
sufficient to add <i>another</i> day to a Bibliographical Decameron. This
copy is in pristine condition, and looks as if snatched from the
press. Mr. Jolley also possesses a very fine and perfect copy of the
first edition of Shakspeare's Works, in folio; but a similar copy, in

<p>We are always extremely cautious in using the designation unique; but
we think we may safely do so upon the present occasion. We have made
very extensive inquiries on the subject, and have recently written to
David Laing, Esq., Keeper of the Library of the Writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span> to the
Signet, from whom we have received a confirmation of our belief.
Beloe, in describing this copy, says "it must be considered as an
indubitable proof that at a very early period the Scotch knew, and
admired, the genius of Shakspeare." He might have continued, its
proceeding from the press of Writtoun, was an additional proof, as he
only published small Popular Tracts. Beloe has erroneously given the
date 1607, and Lowndes has copied his error. The first books printed
by Writtoun were about 1624. His will is printed in the Bannatyne
Miscellany. The second edition of this precious Poem, printed in 1596,
produced the sum of £91, at the sale of Baron Bolland's library: see

<p>The Third Part of Mr. Chalmers's library&mdash;abundantly rich in Scotch
literature, and containing much valuable illustration of the <span class="smcap">History
of Printing in Scotland</span>, will probably quickly succeed the publication
of this Work. Mr. Chalmers had frequently expressed to me his
intention as well as inclination to give a complete History of the
<span class="smcap">Scotish Press</span>; and if the materials collected by him find their way
into his native country, it is to be hoped that some enterprising
spirit, like that which animates the present Librarian of the Signet
Library, will find sufficient encouragement to bring them before the
public. I bargain for a <i>Quarto</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Menalcas</span> (whose fame expands more largely in the <i>Bibliographical
Decameron</i> and <i>Reminiscences</i>) was my old and "very singular good
friend" the Rev. <span class="smcap">Henry Joseph Thomas Drury</span>, Rector of Fingest, and
Second Master of Harrow School; second, because he declined to become
the <i>first</i>. His library, so rich and rare in classical
lore&mdash;manuscript as well as printed&mdash;was sold by Mr. Evans in 1827.
The catalogue contained not fewer than 4729 articles. The bindings,
chiefly in Lewisian calf and morocco, were "de toute beauté;" and the
"oblong cabinet" sparkled as the setting sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span> shot its slanting rays
down the backs of the tomes. Of this catalogue there were 35 copies
only printed upon writing paper, for presents.</p>

<p>This library was strikingly illustrative of the character of its <span class="smcap">late</span>
owner; for it is little more than a twelvemonth since he has been
called away from that numerous and endearing circle, in the midst of
which I saw him sitting, about a twelvemonth before his departure&mdash;the
happiest of the happy&mdash;on the day of the nuptials of his youngest
daughter but one, with Captain Beavan. His books were in fine
condition throughout&mdash;gaily attired in appropriate bindings of calf or
morocco, as the character and condition might be. His love of old
classical <i>Manuscripts</i> was properly and greatly beyond that of
printed books: but each class was so marked and identified by his
calligraphical MS. notes, that you were in a moment convinced his
books were not purchased for the mere sake of gorgeous furniture. So
entirely were his classical feelings mixed up with his Library, that
he prefixed, over the entrance door of his oblong cabinet, in printed
letters of gold, the following lines&mdash;of which the version is supplied
from the "<i>Arundines Cami</i>," edited by his eldest son, the Rev. Henry
Drury.</p>

<p class="bp">They were part and parcel of the <i>Owner</i> himself. His mind was
traceable in many a fly leaf. His latinity was perspicuity and
accuracy itself. He was, in all respects, a ripe and a good scholar;
and the late Provost of Eton (The Rev. Dr. Goodall) told me, on an
occasion which has been, perhaps, too <i>emphasised</i> in certain
bibliographical pages,<a name="FNanchor_476_484" id="FNanchor_476_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_484" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> that "England could not then produce a
better Greek metrical scholar than his friend Henry Drury." What was
remarkable, he never assumed an <i>ex Cathedrâ</i> position in society. In
bringing forward or pressing quotations, whatever fell from him, came
easily and naturally, but rarely. Accustomed for many years to be the
favourite of the <i>Harrovians</i>, he never affected the airs of the
pedagogue. How he <i>could</i> criticise, sufficiently appears in an
article on the <i>Musæ Edinburgenses</i> in an early number of the
Quarterly Review.</p>

always appeared to me to <i>affect</i> irascibility upon the
subject alluded to. The contents might have been published
at Charing Cross.</p>
</div>

<p class="tp">Yet this may be considered secondary matter; and I hasten to record
the qualities of his heart and disposition. They were truly
Christian-like; inasmuch as a fond and large spirit of benevolence was
always beating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span> in his bosom, and mantling over a countenance of
singular friendliness of expression. He had the <i>power</i> of saying
sharp and caustic things, but he used his "giant-strength" with the
gentleness of a child. His letters, of which many hundreds have fallen
to my lot, are a perfect reflex of his joyous and elastic mind. There
was not a pupil under his care who looked forward to a <i>holiday</i> with
more unqualified delight than <i>he</i>; and when we strayed together
beneath, or upon the heights of, the Dover Cliffs (where I <i>last</i> saw
him, in the summer of 1840) he would expatiate, with equal warmth and
felicity, upon the Abbey of St. Rhadagund, and the Keep of Dover
Castle. Our visit to Barfreston Church, in the neighbourhood, can
never be effaced from my mind. His mental enthusiasm and bodily
activity could not have been exceeded by that of the Captain of Harrow
School. He took up my meditated "History of the Dover" as if it were
his own work; and his success, in cause of subscription, in most
instances, was complete.</p>

<p>And now, after an intimacy (minutely recorded in my <i>Reminiscences</i>)
of thirty-three years, it has pleased God to deprive me of his genial
and heart-stirring society. His last moments were of those of a
Christian&mdash;"rooted and built up" in <span class="smcap">that</span> belief, which alone sustains
us in the struggle of parting from those whom we cherish as the most
idolised objects upon earth! It was towards sun-set that I first
paused upon his tomb, in the church-yard, near the summit of Harrow
Hill. For a few moments I was breathless&mdash;but <i>not</i> from the steepness
of the ascent. The inscription, I would submit, is too much in the
"minor key." It was the production of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span> eldest son, who preferred
to err from under-rating, rather than over-rating, the good qualities
of his parent. For myself&mdash;</p>

<p>On the death of Mr. Drury, his small library, the remains of his
former one, was sold by auction; and those classical books,
interleaved, and enriched with his manuscript notes, brought large
prices. One manuscript, of especial celebrity&mdash;<i>Childe Harold</i>&mdash;given
him by the Author, his pupil, Lord Byron&mdash;became the property of its
publisher, Mr. Murray; who purchased it upon terms at once marking his
high sense of the talents of the author, and his respect for the
family where it had been placed. It may be doubtful whether the
autograph of any poem, since Paradise Lost, would have obtained a
larger sum&mdash;had it been submitted to public sale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rinaldo.</span>&mdash;Rinaldo was the late Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>; of the sale of whose

the lapse of thirty years. Let <i>half</i> of another similar course of
time roll on, and where will the <span class="smcap">Survivors</span> be? If not at rest in their
graves, they will in all probability be "sans teeth, sans eyes, sans
everything:"&mdash;at least, very far beyond "the lean and slippered
pantaloon." Leaving my surviving friends to fight their own battles, I
think I may here venture to say, in quiet simplicity and singleness of
heart, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span> books, book-sales, and book-men, will then&mdash;if I am

former was intended to represent the late Sir Masterman Mark Sykes,
Bart.: the latter, a William Templeman, Esq., of Hare Hatch,
Berkshire. Sir Mark Sykes was not less known than respected for the
suavity of his manners, the kindness of his disposition, and the
liberality of his conduct on all matters connected with <i>books</i> and
<i>prints</i>. A long and particular account of his library, and of many of
his book-purchases, will be seen in the third volume of the
<i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>; and at pages 321, 373 of my <i>Literary
Reminiscences</i>. His library and his prints brought, each, pretty much
the same sum: together, £60,000&mdash;an astounding result! Sir Mark is the
last great bibliomaniacal Sun that has shed its golden, as well as
parting, rays, upon a terribly chap-fallen British public! Mr.
Templeman, repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>sented as Narcottus, was a great Chess-player: and
although Caxton's "Game at Chess" is a mere dull morality, having
nothing to do with the game strictly so called, yet he would have
everything in his library where the word "Chess" was introduced. In
the words of the old catch, he would "add the night unto the day" in
the prosecution of his darling recreation, and boasted of having once
given a signal defeat to the Rev. Mr. Bowdler, after having been
defeated himself by Lord Henry Seymour, the renowned chess-champions
of the Isle of Wight. He said he once sat upon Phillidor's knee, who
patted his cheek, and told him "there was nothing like Chess and
English roast beef."</p>

<p class="bp">The notice of poor George Faulkner at <a href="#Page_199">page 199</a>&mdash;one of the more
celebrated book-binders of the day, is amplified at page 524 of the
second volume of the Decameron; where the painful circumstances
attending his death are slightly mentioned. He yet lives, and lives
strongly, in my remembrance. Since then, indeed within a very few
years, the famous <span class="smcap">Charles Lewis</span>&mdash;of whose bibliopegistic renown the
Decameronic pages have expatiated fully&mdash;has ceased to be. He was
carried off suddenly by an apoplectic seizure. His eldest son&mdash;a sort
of "spes altera Romæ," in his way&mdash;very quickly followed the fate of
his father. The name of <span class="smcap">Lewis</span> will be always held high in the
estimation of bibliopegistic Virtuosi. But the art of Book-binding is
not deteriorating: and I am not sure whether <span class="smcap">John Clarke</span>, of Frith
Street, Soho, be not as "mighty a man" in his way as any of his
predecessors. There is a solidity, strength, and squareness of
workmanship about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span> books, which seem to convince you that they may
be tossed from the summit of Snowdon to that of Cader Idris without
detriment or serious injury. His gilding is first rate; both for
choice of ornament and splendour of gold. Nor is his coadjutor,
<span class="smcap">William Bedford</span>, of less potent renown. He was the great adjunct of
the late Charles Lewis&mdash;and imbibes the same taste and the same spirit
of perseverance. Accident brought me one morning in contact with a set
of the New Dugdale's Monasticon, bound in blue morocco, and most
gorgeously bound and gilded, lying upon the table of Mr. James Bohn&mdash;a
mountain of bibliopegistic grandeur! A sort of irrepressible awe kept
you back even from turning over the coats or covers! And what a
<span class="smcap">Work</span>&mdash;deserving of pearls and precious stones in its outward
garniture! "Who was the happy man to accomplish such a piece of
binding?"<a name="FNanchor_477_485" id="FNanchor_477_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_485" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> observed I. "Who <span class="smcap">but</span> John Clarke?"&mdash;replied the
Bibliopole.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

gadding abroad every where. At Oxford, they have "a spirit"
of this description who loses a night's rest if he haplessly
shave off the sixteenth part of an inch of a rough edge of
an uncut Hearne. My friend, Dr. Bliss, has placed volumes
before me, from the same mintage, which have staggered
belief as an indigenous production of Academic soil. At
Reading, also, some splendid leaves are taken from the same
<i>Book</i>. Mr. Snare, the publisher, keeps one of the most
talented bookbinders in the kingdom&mdash;from the school of
Clarke; and feeds him upon something more substantial than
rose leaves and jessamine blossoms. He is a great man for a
halequin's jacket: and would have gone crazy at the sight of
some of the specimens at Strawberry Hill. No man can put a
varied-coloured morocco coat upon the back of a book with
greater care, taste, and success, than our Reading
Bibliopegist.</p>

<p>the residence of the late proprietor of this work. There we once
beheld such a copy of the best of all existing <i>Encyclopædias</i>&mdash;that
of the late Dr. <span class="smcap">Rees</span>&mdash;as is no where else to be found. It was upon
<i>large</i> and <i>fine</i> paper&mdash;bound in fourscore volumes&mdash;with separately
executed title pages, in a style of pure art&mdash;and <i>illustrated</i> with
not fewer than <span class="smcap">ten thousand extra plates</span>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span> reader may, and will,
naturally enough, judge of the wide, if not boundless, field for
illustration&mdash;comprehending in fact (as the title of the work
denounces) the circle of all knowledge, arts and sciences; but he can
have no idea of the <i>manner</i> in which this fertile and illimitable
field is filled up, till he gazes upon the copy in question. Here then
was not only a <i>reading</i>, but a <i>graphic</i>, <span class="smcap">Library in itself</span>. Whatever
other works <i>profusely</i> dilate upon was here <i>concentrated</i>&mdash;and
deeply impressed upon the mind by the charm, as well as the
intelligence, of graphical ornament. You seemed to want nothing, as,
upon the turning over of every leaf, the prodigality of art ennobled,
while it adorned, the solidity of the text. You have kept your horses
already waiting three hours&mdash;and they are neighing and snorting for
food: and you must turn them into the stable for suitable
provender&mdash;for the owner of this production would tell you that you
had scarcely traversed through one-third of the contents of the
volumes. He orders an additional fowl to be placed on the spit, and an
extra flagon of Combe and Delafield's brightest ale to be
forth-coming: while his orchard supplies the requisite addenda of
mulberries, pears, and apples, to flank the veritable Lafitte. You
drink and are merry. Then comes the Argand Lamp; and down with the
Encyclopedistic volumes. The plates look brighter and more beautiful.
There is no end of them&mdash;nor limits to your admiration. Be it summer
or winter, there is food for sustenance, and for the gratification of
the most exquisite palate. To contemplate <span class="smcap">such</span> a performance, the
thorough-bred book-votary would travel by torch-light through
forty-eight hours of successive darkness!...: But the horses are again
neighing&mdash;for their homes. You must rouse the slumbering post-boy: for
"The bell of the church-clock strikes <span class="smcap">one</span>."</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;The late Mr. <span class="smcap">Walmsley</span>&mdash;who employed me to print this present
edition&mdash;narrowly watched all our movements, and was much gratified by
the appearance of the work, so far as it had gone before his
death&mdash;frequently urged me to append a short account of the progress
of our art during the last thirty years&mdash;i.e. since the publication of
the former edition of <i>Bibliomania</i>.</p>

<p>The subject is too diffuse for a mere note: and during the life-time
of so many able printers as now exercise their calling in the
metropolis, it would be invidious to particularize eminence in our
profession (whereas among our immediate predecessors it is, perhaps
just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span> to say that there were only <i>two</i> printers of great celebrity,
the late <i>Mr. Bulmer</i> and my late father). I shall therefore merely
mention some events which have had such influence on our art as that
the case is now very different to what it was thirty years ago, when
the good execution of printing at once testified to the skill and
industry of the printer&mdash;as he could command neither good <i>presses</i>,
<i>types</i>, nor <i>ink</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;paper being then almost the only matter to be
had in perfection.</p>

<p>We have <i>now</i> excellent and powerful iron presses&mdash;Stanhopes,
Columbians, Imperials, &amp;c. <i>Then</i> the celebrated specimens of
typography were produced by <i>miserable</i> wooden presses. We have <i>now</i>
ink of splendid lustre, at a fourth of the cost of fabrication
<i>then</i>&mdash;for both Mr. Bulmer and my father were perpetually trying
expensive experiments&mdash;and not always succeeding: our ink is now to be
depended on for <i>standing</i>, it works freely, and can be had at
reasonable prices at the extensive factory of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Shackell</span> and
<span class="smcap">Lyons</span>, Clerkenwell, who made the ink used for this work.</p>

<p>There are several eminent engineers who make the best of presses. Our
<i>letter</i> may safely be pronounced, if not perfect, as near perfection
as it will ever reach&mdash;and while the celebrated type-foundries of
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Caslon</span>, Chiswell Street, and Messrs. <span class="smcap">Figgins</span>, West Street, are
within the reach of the metropolitan printers, there can be no excuse
for failing to execute good printing on the score of inferior type.</p>

<p>The substitution of the <i>inking roller</i>, instead of the cumbrous and
inconvenient old balls, has much eased the labours of the pressman and
facilitated the regularity of colour. The inking roller at the hand
press was adopted, and offered to the printers generally, by my
friend, Mr. <span class="smcap">Applegath</span>, shortly after <i>steam-printing</i> was introduced
by my father&mdash;about which so much has been said in periodical
publications, &amp;c., that it is needless here to enlarge on the
subject&mdash;more especially as it is principally applicable to work of
inferior character, newspapers, reviews, magazines, &amp;c.; and, further,
it is not a very tempting subject to the son of him who was led to
devote the energies of the latter years of his active life, and the
well-earned fortune which his great typographical celebrity had
secured, to the adoption of a mode of printing which, how much soever
it may benefit newspaper proprietors and others&mdash;certainly has done
any thing but benefit his family; and has thus added another instance
to the many on record of the ill success attending the patronage of
inventors.</p>
